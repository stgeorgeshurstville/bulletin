| From the Passage | Heavenly Father, <br><br> We come before you today with fragile hearts, much like the clay jars you describe. We confess that it is so easy to lose heart when the pressures of life mount. We get pressed, perplexed, persecuted, and struck down, and the temptation to hide away and stop striving. We're tempted to be admired from a distance, but ultimately untouched and unused, with the treasure you've placed in us remaining hidden. <br> But Lord, we thank you that you have not left us alone in our frailty. You have placed an immeasurable treasure inside of us: the light of the knowledge of your glory, revealed in the face of Christ. You are the source of our power, the life that was victorious over death. <br> We pray for the courage to persevere. Give us the strength to endure, to be broken by the world's challenges, not so that we are destroyed, but so that your light might be revealed. Help us to identify with the death of Jesus, so that we may also reveal His life in our mortal bodies. <br><br> May we be willingly used and worn down, so that the gospel of your grace can surge out for the world to see. May our lives become a living testimony to your all-surpassing power. Use our brokenness to be a pleasing aroma of Christ to those around us, so that they too might be drawn to the light and find life in you. <br><br> In your precious name we pray, Amen. |

| Church Ministries | **English Congregation:** Heavenly Father, <br> We thank you for the blessing of our new meeting place for the 9:30 service at Hurstville Public School. Thank you for providing that congregation with that space to gather, worship, and grow together as a church family. <br> We are especially thankful for the unique opportunities that this location provides. We pray that as they meet at the same time as the language-based Chinese school, you would open doors for us to build genuine relationships and make meaningful connections within that community. We also pray that you would open up opportunities for us to invite them to join us for our "All Generations" services during the holidays. <br> Lord, we ask that you would fill us with your love for our neighbors. Give us wisdom and courage to not only serve them, but also to clearly and compassionately present the gospel to them, so that they too may come to know your son, Jesus Christ. May our presence in this school be a testament to your grace and love. <br> We praise you, Amen.
