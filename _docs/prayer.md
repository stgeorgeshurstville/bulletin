**Church Ministries**

1. **CanCare**: Heavenly Father, we praise You for Your mercy and kindness. You understand the trials and suffering we face and are compassionate toward our weaknesses. We thank You for using CanCare to support those who are battling or have overcome cancer, along with their families and friends. Through Christ’s love, they serve and walk alongside them on this challenging journey. Lord, we ask for Your continued guidance over the CanCare team in the new year. Grant them wisdom, discernment, and a spirit of unity as they care for this community. In 2025, as CanCare embarks on a series of initiatives and programs to raise public awareness about cancer, we pray for Your protection and guidance in all their efforts. May everything be carried out according to Your will, bringing hope and support to those in need.

2. **Evangelism teams**: Gracious Lord, we thank You for the opportunities You have given us to proclaim Your name to those who are lost and far from You. Please continue to open our eyes to see the people You place before us, and grant us boldness and wisdom to share the mystery of the Gospel without fear. We pray that the seeds of the Gospel will be scattered and planted in good soil this year. Lord, prepare the hearts of those we encounter. Remove the barriers that hinder the Gospel, and instead, create rich, healthy soil in their hearts, ready to receive the good news of Jesus Christ. Strengthen and unite our team as we labor together for Your kingdom. May the words we speak and the lives we live reflect Your love and truth, drawing people closer to You. We pray for a fruitful year, trusting in Your power to bring the harvest.

3. **Nursing home**: Dear Heavenly Father, You are the God of grace and hope. You understand every challenge and burden that each elderly person carries in their heart. We ask for Your mighty hand to touch their lives and bring comfort to their souls. Help them to turn their hearts fully to You, trust in You completely, and find true peace and blessings in Your presence. For those living in nursing homes or requiring special care at home, may they deeply experience the love of Christ surrounding them. Lord, use every member of the care and visitation team as a channel of Your love. May those they visit feel the joy and encouragement of genuine fellowship and the fullness of love shared among them. 


**Groups in Church**

**1. Cantonese Congregation**: Lord, we pray for our brothers and sisters of the Cantonese congregation, asking for strength and wisdom as we walk this journey of faith together. Lead us to grow deeper in Christ, to know more of Your truth and love, and to live lives that reflect Your glory. Help us to rely on You in every challenge and opportunity, trusting in Your plans and provisions. Bless our ministry teams and every member of our congregation, uniting us in heart and purpose as we serve together for the glory of Your name. May we demonstrate Christ’s love in our church and beyond. Strengthen us to be faithful witnesses of the Gospel. Open doors for us to share Your love, and equip us to bring hope to those who need You. Let our lives be a testimony of Your grace, so that more people may come to know and experience the joy of salvation in Jesus Christ. Amen.

**2. Volunteers**: Heavenly Father, we pray for all the  volunteers in  different ministry positions at St. George's  Hurstville Anglican Church, especially for the brothers and sisters who are new to the ministries. May God equip them and help them grow and mature. Lead them to use the gifts and talents You have given them to serve You and others. Pray that God will empower them to love and care for Your  people with patience and kindness, and together build up the Body of Christ - the Church. In the name of Christ we pray, Amen!
