## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** Almighty God, who taught the hearts of your faithful people by sending to them the light of your Holy Spirit: grant to us by the same Spirit to have a right judgement in all things and always to rejoice in his holy comfort; through the merits of Christ Jesus our Saviour, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Loving and compassionate Father, You are full of grace and kindness, patient and overflowing with love and faithfulness. Your holiness and fairness shine brightly, yet you never turn away from those who seek you. We find our safety and comfort in you, our God. Our lives are entrusted to your care, and we trust in your unfailing love. O faithful God, as we come before your throne of grace through Jesus, we humbly ask for your mercy and grace to meet our every need. May your Spirit work within us, producing in us the beautiful fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In the precious name of your beloved Son, we pray. Amen.
- **Saviour:** God of all grace, You have given me a Savior. Grant me the faith to rely on Him completely, making Him my desire, hope, and glory. May I find refuge in Him, build my life upon His teachings, and walk in His ways. Let me follow His example, heed His guidance, and trust in His intercession. May I never be ashamed of Him, but proudly bear His name and teachings. Keep me from being swayed by the world's allurements or frightened by its threats. Help me to remember that this world is not my home, but that I am a pilgrim seeking a heavenly country. May I grow daily in readiness for that eternal home, and may all I do be done in the name of the Savior. Amen.
- **Growing Deep:** Oh Lord, how We love your law! Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path. Thank you that Jesus has give us the Word of Eternal Life. Thank you that heaven and earth may pass away but our Lord’s words will never pass away. Please help us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds by your Word. Please help us to deepen our understanding of and obedience to your Word. 
- **Sermon:** Merciful Father, power, wealth, health and wisdom have made us foolishly self reliant and arrogant towards you and unloving towards our fellow human beings. Our hearts are hard and we cannot change and save ourselves. Thank you for your compassion towards us. Thank you for stepping into the world to save the lost. Thank you for our Messiah, Jesus who bore our judgement so that we can experience your mercy. We long for all the lost to be found and saved but above all we long for all to honour Jesus as the Lord. Please hear our prayers in His name, Amen.  


## Mission Partner Focus
- **JC in SE Asia:** You call us to make and mature disciples of all nations. We ask that you’ll allow JC to courageously, lovingly and prayerfully share the gospel in a country where evangelism is not allowed and even publicly practicing one’s faith is difficult (including the recent events over Easter). May you soften the hearts of the authorities and the people so that they’ll hear and accept the peace, purpose and real spiritual prosperity in Jesus. May you save JC’s family. May you raise up Christians and leaders in the university and church.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Government:** You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May leaders enact laws and initiatives so that orphans, widows and the harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit to their authority as we hold out the word of life and ultimately submit to you. Give us wisdom to live and love even when laws make it more difficult such as in the areas of religion freedom, conversion practices, abortion and euthanasia. 
- **Children:** Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow their hearts to love Jesus and become more like Him each day. Give strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to genuinely love the kids and show them Jesus.
- **Youth:** Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength and security in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness and at times feelings of hopelessness. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities and temptations. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness. May they have a secure attachment to Jesus especially as we go through different beliefs and behaviours that may draw us away such as materialism, expressive individualism and hedonism. May we be a church family who are joyful and godly witnesses as we aim to be transformed together and represent Jesus.
- **SRE:** Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus in our local public school. May we never take this for granted. Give our combined Christian teacher team (Lam, Carol, George, Fiona, Alice, Tracey, Glorya, Fiona, and Felishia) strength to keep teaching and witnessing faithfully.
- **Mandarin Congregation:** Lord, we pray for wisdom for our Mandarin congregations as they seek to implement the plans from their Planning Retreat from the beginning of the year. We pray that you would raise up faithful and godly team leaders for each area of our gospel growth plans – welcoming team, evangelism team, follow-up team, outreach team etc.
