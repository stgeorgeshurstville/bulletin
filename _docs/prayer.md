## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer**: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.

- **Collect**: Almighty and everlasting God, ruler of all things in heaven and earth, mercifully hear the supplications of your people, and grant us your peace all the days of our life; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

- **Growing Deep**: Oh Lord, how We love your law! Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path. Thank you that Jesus has given us the Word of Eternal Life. Thank you that heaven and earth may pass away but our Lord’s words will never pass away. Please help us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds by your Word. Please help us to deepen our understanding of and obedience to your Word.  

- **Church Sermon**: We are sorry for the times when we are angry for who you are and what you do. We are sorry for when we are jealous and envious of the grace, mercy and love you show to others. Help us to realise that we are all sinners especially when we are tempted to think that we aren’t because of our good works and good standing before others. May our true joy come from the relationship we have with you and from knowing your character and actions. May this joy overflow into all aspects of our loves especially as we see sinners saved. Amen

## Mission Related Prayer Points
- **JC in South-East Asia:** You call us to make and mature disciples of all nations. We ask that you’ll allow JC to courageously, lovingly and prayerfully share the gospel in a country where evangelism is not allowed and even publicly practicing one’s faith is difficult. We give thanks that he can now be an English teacher. May this provide more opportunities to share the God news. May you soften the hearts of the authorities and the people so that they’ll hear and accept the peace, purpose and real spiritual prosperity in Jesus. May you raise up Christians and leaders in the university and church.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Government**: You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May they enact laws and initiatives so that the orphans, widows and harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit to their authority as we hold out the word of life and ultimately submit to you. 
- **Children:** Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow in their hearts a love and desire for Jesus and God’s Word. Give patience, energy and strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life, especially during this holiday period. Be with the kids leaders so that they would grow deeply in their relationship with you and be refreshed for a new year to love the kids and show them Jesus in all that they say and do.
- **Youth:** Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength and security in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness and at times feelings of hopelessness. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities and temptations. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness including during holiday period. May we be a church family who are joyful and godly witnesses as we aim to be transformed together and represent Jesus.
- **SRE:** Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus at Hurstville Public School. May we never take this for granted. Thank you for all the teachers who have faithfully taught the gospel to the children. Please raise up more workers willing to take your Word into our local public school  for the harvest is plentiful.
- **Cantonese Congregations:** Lord, we thank you for the number of brothers and sisters at the 11am and 4pm Mandarin congregations who were baptised last month. We praise you for saving them in Christ and we pray that their love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ--to the glory and praise of God. Amen.
