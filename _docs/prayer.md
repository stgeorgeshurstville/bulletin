## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** Almighty God, you have given your only Son to be for us both a sacrifice for sin and also an example of godly life; give us grace that we may always thankfully receive the immeasurable benefit of his sacrifice, and also daily endeavour to follow in the blessed steps of his most holy life; who now lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for evermore. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Loving and compassionate Father, You are full of grace and kindness, patient and overflowing with love and faithfulness. Your holiness and fairness shine brightly, yet you never turn away from those who seek you. We find our safety and comfort in you, our God. Our lives are entrusted to your care, and we trust in your unfailing love. O faithful God, as we come before your throne of grace through Jesus, we humbly ask for your mercy and grace to meet our every need. May your Spirit work within us, producing in us the beautiful fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In the precious name of your beloved Son, we pray. Amen.
- **Growing Up**: Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day. 
- **Confession**: Dear God, our Father in heaven, You are always loving and good, But we’re not. We haven;t loved You and others like we should. We do things we know are wrong, And we don't do things that are right. We're really sad and sorry. Please forgive us because of Jesus. By your Spirit help us to love You and everyone else, and to live in a way that honours You. Amen.
- **Sermon**: Father, thank You that only you can save people. Thank you for saving me through Jesus. Thank you for choosing to use me even though I am weak and foolish. Thank you that by choosing to save me you are showing my friends and people around me that they too can be saved through Jesus. I am willing to be used by you to do your work in the word. Please help me to trust you. Please use me to bless my friends and family and everyone around me, especially in introducing Jesus to them. Please save them. 


## Weekly Prayer Points
- Bijaya and Kate and the Nepali church plant in the Georges River area.
- LIFE Course. 
- Prayer: Jesus came to seek and to save the lost. You tell us that true religion is to visit orphans and widows in their affliction. May Compassion Australia seek to release children from poverty in Jesus’ name. May we do what we can to love children and their families so that they will mature physically, mentally, socially and most importantly spiritually. May we prayerfully invest in the lives of the children in Sumba Indonesia and see a whole region won and living for God. May you give wisdom to our 11 partner churches in the area to love and care for the children. May these children have enough sustenance, health and support as they participate in the program and activities. For those who personally sponsor a child, may we keep praying, communicating and supporting them and their family. 
- Next Steps: Please speak to Compassion to sponsor a child or go to their website to find more information about the mission trip (https://fieldexperience.compassion.com.au/t/cau/io-sumba-feb-2025). You can speak to someone from the mission subcommittee if you have any questions.

## Mission Partner Focus
Compassion seeks to release children from poverty in Jesus’ name. Many people have come to faith and communities have been changed through their ministries. We are focusing our sponsorship on children in Sumba Indonesia. We believe that together, under God, we can make a real difference in this region over the next 20 years. Currently, our church is sponsoring 100 children. Today, we’ll have Spiro from Compassion Australia who’ll update us about Compassion, how we can sponsor children and how we can come to a mission trip to Sumba in Feb 2025. 


## Regular Prayer Points
Australia: Guide with your wisdom and power the leaders of the nation, so that everyone may live in peace and mutual trust, sharing with justice the resources of the earth. Give the people of this land a spirit of unselfishness, compassion, and fairness in public and private life. May we live quiet and peaceful lives in order that people may come to a knowledge of the truth. We pray that you would give our leaders wisdom and a fear of you. We pray that many in our nation who are suffering may find hope, peace, comfort, life and purpose in the gospel of your Son. May Anthony Albanese and Chris Minns lead Australia and NSW well and make policies that promote love and allow for gospel growth. 
Nursing Homes and Seniors Ministries: We thank you Father, that our hope in Jesus cannot be taken from us. We remember those who are living in residential care, those who are living at home and receiving care, those who are providing the care, and their families. We pray for safety and comfort for the aged. We pray for protection for the carers, workers and volunteers from COVID and other dangers. We pray that all will hear and experience the love and peace of Christ. 
Cantonese Congregations: Lord, we pray for your continuous guidance and protection over our brothers and sisters of the Cantonese congregation. May your Word strengthen them, reminding them of your abundant grace and sufficiency in all circumstances. Guide us in pursuing our vision in a “secure attachment to Jesus” and our growth in it. We pray that everyone can come to know you more intimately and walk with you daily. We pray for our discipleship groups that each member would personally engage with the Bible and deepen their relationship with you. We pray for the Gospel class starting from March 17, that the seekers may encounter Jesus through the study of your Word and joyfully embrace Him as their Saviour. Amen.
