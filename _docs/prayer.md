## Sunday Prayer Points


  
- **Collect:** We beseech you, almighty God, to look in mercy on your people: that by your great goodness they may be governed and preserved evermore; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Mission:** Our gracious Father, thank you for the privilege of calling us to join in your mission. Thank you that under you what we do makes a difference in the world. We pray therefore that you will save those around us and to transform them into the likeness of Jesus. Please use us to make disciples of the nations, love our neighbours. Please Father, glorify yourself, through our labour in your Son. We pray that we will not be consumers but contributors to the ministries that you have called us to. 
- **Vision 2024:** Secure Attachment to Jesus: Loving and compassionate Father, You are full of grace and kindness, patient and overflowing with love and faithfulness. Your holiness and fairness shine brightly, yet you never turn away from those who seek you. We find our safety and comfort in you, our God. Our lives are entrusted to your care, and we trust in your unfailing love. O faithful God, as we come before your throne of grace through Jesus, we humbly ask for your mercy and grace to meet our every need. May your Spirit work within us, producing in us the beautiful fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In the precious name of your beloved Son, we pray. Amen.

- **Church Sermon:**

Great was the joy of Israel’s sons,  
      when Egypt died upon the shore,  
      Far greater the joy  
      when the Redeemer’s foe lay crushed  
      in the dust.  
Jesus strides forth as the victor,  
  conqueror of death, hell, and all opposing  
    might;  
He bursts the bands of death,  
  tramples the powers of darkness down,  
  and lives forever.
He, my gracious surety,
  apprehended for payment of my debt,
  comes forth from the prison house of the grave
  free, and triumphant over sin, Satan, and death.
Show me herein the proof that his vicarious offering
    is accepted,
  that the claims of justice are satisfied,
  that the devil’s sceptre is shivered,
  that his wrongful throne is levelled.
Give me the assurance that in Christ I died,
  in him I rose,
  in his life I live, in his victory I triumph,
  in his ascension I shall be glorified.
Adorable Redeemer,
  thou who wast lifted up upon a cross
  art ascended to highest heaven.
Thou, who as Man of sorrows
  wast crowned with thorns,
  art now as Lord of life wreathed with glory.
Once, no shame more deep than thine,
  no agony more bitter,
  no death more cruel.
Now, no exaltation more high,
  no life more glorious,
  no advocate more effective.
Thou art in the triumph car leading captive
  thine enemies behind thee.
What more could be done than thou hast done!
  Thy death is my life,
  thy resurrection my peace,
  thy ascension my hope,
  thy prayers my comfort.
