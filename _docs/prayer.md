## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer**: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.

- **Collect**: Raise up your great power, Lord, and come among us to save us; that, although through our sins we are grievously hindered in running the race that is set before us, your plentiful grace and mercy may speedily help and deliver us; through the sufficiency of your Son our Lord, to whom with you and the Holy Spirit be honour and glory, now and for ever. Amen.
- **Growing Deep:** Oh Lord, how We love your law! Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path. Thank you that Jesus has give us the Word of Eternal Life. Thank you that heaven and earth may pass away but our Lord’s words will never pass away. Please help us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds by your Word. Please help us to deepen our understanding of and obedience to your Word. 


- **Church Sermon**: Have mercy on us, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out our transgressions.
- 
_Wash us thoroughly from our iniquity, and cleanse us from our sin! For we know our transgressions, and our sin is ever before us._

Against you, you only, have we sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgement.

_Hide your face from our sins, and blot out all our iniquities._

Create in us a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within us.

_Cast us not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from us._

Restore to us the joy of your salvation, and uphold us with a willing spirit.

_For you will not delight in sacrifice, or we would give it;_

you will not be pleased with a burnt offering.

_Our sacrifice, O God, is a broken spirit;_

a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.

Thank you for the coming of your Messiah, our Saviour. Thank you that he has taken up our pain and boren our transgressions, that he was pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities. Thank you that the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. 
We pray that by the power of your Spirit, we will live lives worthy of our Lord. We long for the world to come to your Rest, and that the world will know you. We praise you for your patience. We pray that the Word of our Saviour will go out into all the world through your people that all may know You and your justice and mercy. In the name of your Son. 
 Amen.

## Mission Related Prayer Points
- **JC in SE Asia:** You call us to make and mature disciples of all nations. We ask that you’ll allow JC to courageously, lovingly and prayerfully share the gospel in a country where evangelism is not allowed and even publicly practising one’s faith is difficult. May you soften the hearts of the authorities and the people so that they’ll hear and accept the peace, purpose and real spiritual prosperity in Jesus. May you raise up Christians and leaders in the university and church.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Government**: You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May they enact laws and initiatives so that the orphans, widows and harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit to their authority as we hold out the word of life and ultimately submit to you.

- **Children**: Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow in their hearts a love and desire for Jesus and God’s Word. Give strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to genuinely love the kids. 

- **Youth**: Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength and security in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness and at times feelings of hopelessness. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities and temptations. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness. May we be a church family who are joyful and godly witnesses as we aim to be transformed together and represent Jesus.

- **SRE**: Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus in our local public school. May we never take this for granted. Give our combined Christian teacher team (Lam, Carol, George, Alice, Tracey, Glorya, Fiona, and Andrew) strength to keep teaching and witnessing faithfully. 

- **Mandarin Congregation**: Lord, we pray for the Gospel class after service that people will know Jesus. Not just intellectual knowledge, but reflecting their own life so that Jesus becomes their personal saviour. We pray for the Gospel class after Wednesday English class in June that students will hear the Gospel in their own language. Through the simple form of three word Gospel, and discussion questions, they will see that Gospel is relevant, and believable. We pray for the new Mandarin pastor that he and his congregation will have a smooth transition to our church.
