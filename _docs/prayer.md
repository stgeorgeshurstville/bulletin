## Week 2: Second Sunday of the Month

- **Mission & Vision - For Growing up:** Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day.
- **Global & Nation - Nation:** Lord, may you grant wisdom to world leaders, compassion for the oppressed, and justice for the marginalized. May Your peace reign across borders, and may hearts turn to You, for You are the true source of hope and reconciliation.
- **Mission Partners - Berkeley Life Centre:** Pray for Pastor Wayne’s health and also the plan to transition into retirement coming June 2025, that he would be blessed and find peace in this new season. Lord, please guide and call the right successor to lead Berkeley Life Centre with vision and faithfulness. We pray for the church community to remain strong and united during this leadership change, trusting God’s plans for their future.
- **Church Ministries:** <ins>EAL/D</ins> - Pray for our Wed English class to be a warm, welcoming space where people from the community feel encouraged and supported. We ask for wisdom and patience for the teachers as they help students navigate language and cultural challenges. Pray that relationships formed in the class would lead to open doors for sharing the gospel.
- 
<ins>CanCare</ins> - Pray for comfort, strength, and hope for the cancer patients and their families who attend the support group. We ask God to provide guidance for the leaders as they offer care and support to those going through difficult health journeys. We also pray that each member would find encouragement, connection, and faith as they face challenges together.

<ins>Evangelism teams</ins> - Our heavenly Father, we pray for boldness, compassion, and wisdom for the evangelism teams as they reach out with the gospel in our community. Please open the hearts and minds of the people they encounter  to the message of Jesus Christ. Help us to support one another as witnesses and representatives of Jesus.

<ins>Nursing home</ins> - Lift up families in communities who are caring for people in nursing home. Pray for encouragement, support, and practical resources as they nurture and support their loved ones.
- **Groups in Church - Cantonese congregation:** Lord, we pray for our brothers and sisters of the Cantonese congregation. We ask that You continue to guide them in pursuing our vision in a “secure attachment to Jesus” and our growth in it. We ask for Your blessing upon our ministry teams and all who serve, granting them strength and wisdom. May they work together in unity to serve You, finding comfort in Your strength and joy, knowing that their efforts are for the glory of Your name. We also pray for our discipleship groups, asking You to bless this ministry so that more brothers and sisters can grow in their faith through these small groups and deepen their relationship with You. Help us, through our study of Matthew, to understand Your love and grace more profoundly and inspire us to respond to Your love with action. May we live out a life of faith in a world that values self-reliance and achievement, bearing witness to Your truth and love. Amen.
