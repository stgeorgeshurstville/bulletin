## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer**: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect**: Lord Jesus Christ, for our sake you fasted forty days and forty nights: give us grace to use such abstinence that, our flesh being subdued to the spirit, we may always obey your will in righteousness and true holiness, to your honour and glory; for you live and reign with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God, for evermore. Amen.
- **Growing Deep**: Oh Lord, how We love your law! Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path. Thank you that Jesus has give us the Word of Eternal Life. Thank you that heaven and earth may pass away but our Lord’s words will never pass away. Please help us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds by your Word. Please help us to deepen our understanding of and obedience to your Word. 
- **Church Sermon**: Spend time thinking about the different areas of our lives, and of what’s happening in the world, e.g. ministry, relationship, children, marriage, work, study, friendship, Australian politics, the economy, war, natural disasters, and pray that God’s will be done in them, that God will reign and bless.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Government**: You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May the authorities enact laws and initiatives so that orphans, widows and the harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit to their authority as we hold out the word of life and ultimately submit to you. 
- **Children**: Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow in their hearts a love and desire for Jesus and God’s Word. Give strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to genuinely love the kids. 
- **Youth**: Our Father, you’ve adopted us as your sons and daughters. We can be a part of the family of Christ and the Church because of Jesus. Help us to be a light in a world of darkness. May you help our youths and their families to be firm in their faith and winsome in their witness. May we together wait for Jesus’ return, walk in Christlikeness and witness about God’s glory especially as this year starts. May we be welcoming as we think about how to love the people around us this term. 
- **Mandarin Congregation**: We thank God for the Mandarin ministry Planning Retreat on Australia Day. Thank God for his wisdom in helping them to come up many good plans for the year and beyond. We pray that the Mandarin brothers and sisters may be fully dependent on you to keep growing the gospel, according to your will. In particular, they can use the D-group ministries to welcome new people into church and afterwards to plan personal evangelism or follow-up for them.
