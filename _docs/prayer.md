## Collect
Almighty Father, whose blessed Son was revealed so that he might destroy the works of the devil and make us the children of God and heirs of eternal life: grant that having this hope we may purify ourselves as he is pure; that, when he shall appear again with power and great glory, we may be made like him in his eternal and glorious kingdom, where with you, Father, and with the Holy Spirit, he lives and reigns, one God, for evermore. Amen.

| **From the Passage** | A prayer of Hilary of Portier <br><br> Father, keep us from vain strife of words. Grant to us constant profession of the Truth! Preserve us in a true and undefiled faith so that we may hold fast to that which we professed when we were baptised in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, that we may have Thee for our Father, that we may abide in Thy Son and in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Through Jesus Christ, Our Lord. <br><br> Amen.
