| **From the Passage** | Heavenly Father,<br><br>We acknowledge today that heaven is Your throne and the earth is Your footstool. No house built by human hands can contain Your glory, for Your own hand has made all these things.<br><br>Lord, look with favor upon us. We desire to be the ones to whom You pay attention—those who are humble and contrite in spirit, and who tremble at Your Word. Help us to set aside our own "chosen ways" and instead find our delight in what pleases You.<br><br>We thank You for the promise of Your comfort. Just as a mother comforts her child, wrap Your peace around our hearts and let us find rest in the "Jerusalem" of Your presence.<br><br>May Your hand be known to Your servants, and may Your glory be declared among all nations and tongues, until every heart acknowledges You as King.<br><br>**Amen**|

| **Mission Partners** | **Hoi-Yan Shea in Japan**<br><br> _General Information: Hoi-Yan is a missionary who works with OMF (Overseas Missionary Fellowship) in Japan._ <br><br>Heavenly Father,<br><br>We lift up **Hoi-Yan** to You today as she serves with OMF in Japan. We thank You for her heart for the Japanese people and for the work You are doing through her to share the light of the Gospel.<br><br>As Isaiah 66 declares that You will gather all nations and tongues to see Your glory, we pray that You would use Hoi-Yan as a vessel for that gathering. In a land where so many are seeking purpose and peace, let her life and words point clearly to You.<br><br>We specifically ask for:<br>- **A Contrite Heart**: Keep Hoi-Yan’s spirit humble and "trembling at Your word," as Isaiah 66:2 describes. May her ministry flow from a deep, personal connection with You.<br>- **Supernatural Comfort**: Just as You promised to comfort Your people like a mother, we pray that You would comfort Hoi-Yan in moments of loneliness, cultural fatigue, or discouragement. Let her find her rest and strength in Your presence.<br>- **Spiritual Breakthrough**: Lord, You said You would "bring to delivery" what You have started. We pray for the spiritual "birth" of new believers in Japan. Soften hearts that have been resistant and open eyes to see Your beauty.<br>- **Endurance and Joy**: Grant her the joy of the Lord as her strength. May she see Your hand at work in the small, daily interactions and the long-term relationships she is building.<br><br>Lord, let Your glory be declared among the people of Japan through Hoi-Yan’s service. Protect her, provide for her every need, and bless the OMF team she works alongside.<br><br>**Amen.**|
| **Church Ministries** |**Youth** <br><br>Heavenly Father, we lift up our young people to You. Guard their hearts, guide their choices, and help them know Your truth in a confusing world. Give wisdom and love to their leaders, and may our youth grow to trust You and shine for Jesus. <br><br>**Amen**.|
