| **From the Passage** | **Adoration**<br><br>Heavenly Father, we arise and give you glory, for you are the Everlasting Light that no darkness can overcome. We praise you as the Great Creator who spoke light into the void, and as the Great Redeemer who shines your face upon a broken world. You are the Architect of a city whose gates never shut, a sanctuary where violence is heard no more, and where your presence is our eternal sun.<br><br>**Confession**<br><br>Lord, we confess that we often grope in the darkness like those without eyes. We confess that our own hands have been stained and our hearts have been prone to the very shadows we deplore. Like the people of Judah, we acknowledge that our nature apart from you produces only separation. Forgive us for trying to manufacture a fragile peace through fear and force rather than seeking the peace that comes from your Spirit.<br><br>**Thanksgiving**<br><br>We thank you, Lord Jesus, that you are the True Temple. We thank you that you did not stay distant but became the "Light of the World" who was "torn apart" on the cross so that we might never be torn apart from you. Thank you for the Servant" who donned the breastplate of righteousness to fight for us, not to destroy us, but to redeem us. We thank you for the gift of your Word and your Spirit, which pierce our hearts and make us a new creation.<br><br>We look forward with hope to the day when the sun and moon are no longer needed, for you will be our glory. Help to keep longing for the arrival of the New Jerusalem from heaven where we get to be in your presence forever. But until then, help us to arise and shine and to do your will. We pray all this in the name of the Lamb, the light of the City of God, Jesus Christ<br><br> **Amen.** |
| **Mission and Vision** | **Berkeley Life Centre (BLC)** <br><br>Gracious Father, we lift up our brothers and sisters at Berkeley Life Centre. We thank You for their heart to depend on You as they serve a community facing deep hardship. We join our hearts with theirs in prayer:<br><br> - *For the Mission and Discipleship:* Lord, we pray for the primary goal of bringing the Good News to Berkeley and its growing Muslim community. Strengthen BLC in their mission to make disciples and equip leaders. May every member be developed and equipped to become a more Christlike version of themselves.<br><br> - *For the Op Shop and Volunteers:* We thank You for the Op Shop, providing quality clothing and food sourced from Anglicare and partner churches. Lord, send more Christian volunteers—not just to sort and sell, but to have "Jesus conversations" and offer love to those seeking companionship.<br><br> - *For Strategic Resources:* We ask for Your provision of skilled people to redevelop BLC’s website, manage monthly newsletters, and create videos of testimonies to encourage supporters. Grant the team specific training in how to effectively evangelize to the Muslim community.<br><br> - *For Community Healing and Restoration:* Berkeley faces many challenges—disability, depression, dementia, chronic disease, and the impacts of domestic violence and addiction. We pray for protection against the evil one. Provide the funds and skilled counselors needed to run training courses and 1:1 discipling that bring real hope and life improvement to the marginalized.|
