Amen.

- **Church Sermon**: Gracious Lord and Heavenly Father, Please forgive us for our arrogance and pride. For our boasting in silver and gold, horse and chariots. For trusting in idols of our own making. We long for the day when you will humble the proud and the mountain of your house will be lifted high and the nations will stream to it. We long for the day when all the world will know you and thirst for your Word.  We groan in anticipation of when you will judge the world and bring justice and righteousness for all. Then the world will know peace. Thank you for giving us a glimpse of that Day with the coming of your Son, our Lord Jesus. By the power of your Spirit, help us to walk in the light and shine our light before all that they may glorify you. Amen.  




## Weekly Prayer Points

- **Conflict in the Middle East**: God of the nations, whose kingdom rules over all, have mercy on our broken and divided world. In the land of our Saviour’s birth, banish the spirit that makes for war. Please give wisdom to those you have placed in authority, rescue the captives, shield those in danger, and bind up the broken hearted. For those fighting for justice, may they be strengthened by your grace. For those walking in darkness, may the light of your face shine upon them. Above all, we pray that the people of Israel and the Middle East will find everlasting hope in you. And in the land of your Son’s redeeming death and resurrection, turn hearts to look to the Saviour and live. Bring peace, Lord, while we wait for Christ's coming and rule, when all people will beat their swords into plowshares, when nation will not take up sword against nation, and when every tear will be wiped away by the Prince of Peace and Lord of Lords, Amen

- **Indigenous Australians**: Holy Father, God of Love, You are the Creator of this land and of all good things. Our hope is in you because you gave your Son Jesus to reconcile the world to you. We pray for your strength and grace to forgive, accept and love one another, as you love us and forgive and accept us in the sacrifice of your Son. Give us the courage to accept the realities of our history so that we may build a better future for our nation. Teach us to respect all cultures. Teach us to care for our land and waters. Help us to share justly the resources of this land. Help us to bring about spiritual and social change to improve the quality of life for all groups in our communities, especially the disadvantaged. Help young people to find true dignity and self esteem by your Spirit. May your power and love be the foundations on which we build our families, our communities and our nation, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

- **International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women (25 Nov)**: Loving God, creator and sustainer of all, you created humankind in your image, female and male you created them. You created us for loving relationship, but our relationships are often marred by sin. On this international day, for the elimination of violence against women, we lament the reality of broken relationships. We particularly pray for women and girls who are subjected to violence in their intimate relationships, their families or their communities. We ask for your care and protection for those who are vulnerable due to poverty, war or community attitudes. We pray that women and girls will be treated with respect and dignity. We ask that you shine a light into places of darkness where this violence is occurring, and that you will continue to raise up those who work for the elimination of this violence against women. Give them strength, courage and compassion. Help them to find refuge in Jesus. Help us to speak truthfully when we witness violence or oppression of any person, female or male, young or old. May our churches be safe havens for those who have experienced violence and abuse; where they can find comfort and healing in a loving community led by a loving and just God. Give us courage to act for justice as we hold out the Word of Life. In the name of Jesus our saviour.
