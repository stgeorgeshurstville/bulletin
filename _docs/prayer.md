| From the Passage | Heavenly Father,
We come before you today with fragile hearts, much like the clay jars you describe. We confess that it is so easy to lose heart when the pressures of life mount. We get pressed, perplexed, persecuted, and struck down, and the temptation to hide away and stop striving. We're tempted to be admired from a distance, but ultimately untouched and unused, with the treasure you've placed in us remaining hidden. <br>
But Lord, we thank you that you have not left us alone in our frailty. You have placed an immeasurable treasure inside of us: the light of the knowledge of your glory, revealed in the face of Christ. You are the source of our power, the life that was victorious over death.
We pray for the courage to persevere. Give us the strength to endure, to be broken by the world's challenges, not so that we are destroyed, but so that your light might be revealed. Help us to identify with the death of Jesus, so that we may also reveal His life in our mortal bodies.
May we be willingly used and worn down, so that the gospel of your grace can surge out for the world to see. May our lives become a living testimony to your all-surpassing power. Use our brokenness to be a pleasing aroma of Christ to those around us, so that they too might be drawn to the light and find life in you.
In your precious name we pray, Amen. |

May we be a source of joy and not a source of grief to them. May their service result in glory and praise to our Lord. Amen|
