## Week B


| From the Passage | Gracious God, <br><br> We thank You that You are the God who cares, who comforts, who saves. We thank You for the confidence You have given us through the resurrection of Jesus — that death is defeated, Your promises are sure, and glory is eternal. <br><br> Thank You that as we speak of Jesus, others can come to share in Your grace. <br><br> Yet we confess: any things in this world cause us to lose heart. We are easily distracted, often fearful, and too ready to stay silent and speak only of things of temporary value. <br><br> By the power of Your Spirit, through the gospel of Your Son, open our eyes to see reality as it truly is — to see troubles and treasures in light of Your eternal glory. <br><br> Father, may the weight of Your glory in the face of Your Son compel us to speak, and never stop speaking. Please give us opportunities this week to speak of Jesus. And when we speak, shine Your light into darkness, so that thanksgiving may overflow to Your glory. <br><br> In Jesus’ name we pray. Amen. | 

| A Prayer for Father's Day | Gracious God, <br><br> On this Father's Day, we come before you with grateful hearts, giving thanks for the gift of fathers and the vital role they play in our lives and our families. We thank you for their strength, their love, and their commitment. <br><br> We also lift up those who are grieving the loss of their fathers. For those carrying the weight of absence and sadness, we ask for your peace and comfort. Be a source of healing for their hearts and a light in their mourning. <br><br> Lord, we ask that you equip fathers to be the men you have called them to be. Help them to be role models of integrity and humility, living lives that reflect your character. May they be gentle and sacrificial, always putting the needs of their families before their own. <br><br> Guide them to be sources of encouragement and affection, building up the members of their families with words and actions that affirm their worth. <br><br> Above all, we pray that fathers would be leaders in their homes, teaching the members in their family what it looks like to be a true follower of Jesus. May their lives be a testament to your grace and love. <br><br> Amen. |

May these efforts allow CanCare’s vision and care to reach even more Chinese people across Australia. Through these ministries, may Your great power and steadfast love be revealed to this generation. <br><br> **Nursing Home/ Pastoral Care Teams** <br><br> Dear Heavenly Father, You are the God of grace and hope.

Help them to turn their hearts fully to You, trust in You completely, and find true peace and blessings in Your presence. For those living in nursing homes or requiring special care at home, may they deeply experience the love of Christ surrounding them. Lord, use every member of the care and visitation team as a channel of Your love. May those they visit feel the joy and encouragement of genuine fellowship and the fullness of love shared among them. |
