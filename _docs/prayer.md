## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** Graciously hear us, Lord God; and grant that we, to whom you have given the desire to pray, may by your mighty aid be defended and strengthened in all dangers and adversities; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Loving and compassionate Father, You are full of grace and kindness, patient and overflowing with love and faithfulness. Your holiness and fairness shine brightly, yet you never turn away from those who seek you. We find our safety and comfort in you, our God. Our lives are entrusted to your care, and we trust in your unfailing love. O faithful God, as we come before your throne of grace through Jesus, we humbly ask for your mercy and grace to meet our every need. May your Spirit work within us, producing in us the beautiful fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In the precious name of your beloved Son, we pray. Amen.
- **Saviour:** God of all grace, You have given me a Savior. Grant me the faith to rely on Him completely, making Him my desire, hope, and glory. May I find refuge in Him, build my life upon His teachings, and walk in His ways. Let me follow His example, heed His guidance, and trust in His intercession. May I never be ashamed of Him, but proudly bear His name and teachings. Keep me from being swayed by the world's allurements or frightened by its threats. Help me to remember that this world is not my home, but that I am a pilgrim seeking a heavenly country. May I grow daily in readiness for that eternal home, and may all I do be done in the name of the Savior. Amen.
- **Growing Deep:** Oh Lord, how We love your law! Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path. Thank you that Jesus has give us the Word of Eternal Life. Thank you that heaven and earth may pass away but our Lord’s words will never pass away. Please help us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds by your Word. Please help us to deepen our understanding of and obedience to your Word. 
- **Sermon:** God of all nations and our Father in heaven, We are distressed by the brokenness of our world. By war and violence. By the pain and suffering. It’s easy to be self righteous and point the finger at others, but if we’re honest, we can see the same spirit that makes for war and strife in ourselves. Our hearts are stubborn and prideful. Like Egypt, we have foolishly boasted. Thank you that you care about a world such as ours, and for people such as us. Thank you that we have compassion on perpetrators and victims. Thank you will not allow evil and sin to go unpunished but will also extend mercy. Thank you for Jesus. You are a God who will humble the proud and lift up the humble. Our merciful Father, we turn to you for mercy. Save our world. Save us. In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.

## Mission Partner Focus

- **JC in SE Asia**: You call us to make and mature disciples of all nations. We ask that you’ll allow JC to courageously, lovingly and prayerfully share the gospel in a country where evangelism is not allowed and even publicly practicing one’s faith is difficult. May you soften the hearts of the authorities and the people so that they’ll hear and accept the peace, purpose and real spiritual prosperity in Jesus. May you raise up Christians and leaders in the university and church. May you save JC’s immediate and extended family.

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Government**: You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May they enact laws and initiatives so that the orphans, widows and harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit to their authority as we hold out the word of life and ultimately submit to you. 
- **Children**: Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow their hearts to love Jesus and become more like Him each day. Give strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to genuinely love the kids and show them Jesus. 
- **Youth**: Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength and security in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness and at times feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. May it be a safe and respectful environment where youths can explore their questions and find answers and true meaning. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities, pressures and temptations. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness. May they have a secure attachement to Jesus especially this term as we go through different beliefs and behaviours that may draw us away such as materialism, expressive individualism and hedonism. May we be a church family who are joyful and godly witnesses as we aim to be transformed together and represent Jesus.
- **SRE**: Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus in our local public school. May we never take this for granted. Give our combined Christian teacher team (Lam, Carol, George, Fiona, Alice, Tracey, Glorya, Fiona, and Felishia) strength to keep teaching and witnessing faithfully. 
- **Mandarin Congregation**: We thank God for the many new people who come to our Mandarin services and also people who are keen to know and follow Jesus. We pray for the welcoming team that they can link them up with our D-groups and for our D-group leaders and members to faithfully care for them. We pray that you would give wisdom in organising appropriate Investigating Christianity and Follow-up classes for them.
