| **From the Passage** | Heavenly Father, we thank You that the Spirit of the Sovereign Lord rests upon the Anointed One, Jesus Christ, who has come to proclaim the ultimate Year of Jubilee. We confess that we often live like captives to our own discontent, trapped in a cycle of feeling that we are never enough and have never "arrived." We thank You that just as the ancient ruins were rebuilt, You are in the business of restoring our fractured identities. Lord, bind up our brokenheartedness and release us from the "eternal debts" of sin and shame that we could never pay on our own. <br><br>We marvel at the Great Exchange of the Gospel: that You take our heavy ashes and bestow a crown of beauty; You take our spirit of despair and wrap us in a garment of praise. Thank You for stopping the hand of vengeance to offer us a season of radical grace. Help us to trade our self-centeredness for Your righteousness, wearing the "wedding clothes" You have provided with humility and joy. May we live today as a garden of Your glory, secure in the double portion of Your blessing and the faithfulness of Your everlasting covenant. Amen. <br><br> **Amen.** |

We thank you specifically for her story—the powerful testimony of how you reached into the darkness and brought her from death to life. We praise you that you didn't just save her from sin, but saved her for a purpose, transforming her heart to live entirely for your glory. We thank you that you have placed a fire in her soul to make the name of Jesus known among the international students at Adelaide University.<br><br>**For Rest and Renewal**<br><br>Lord, we thank you for the gift of the summer months.

Fill her cup to overflowing so that she is ready and eager for the mission ahead.<br><br>**For the Mission at FOCUS**<br><br>As the new academic year approaches, we lift up the FOCUS ministry.
