| **From the Passage** | O Lord, Our God, we lift up the brokenness of our world, <br><br>We feel the weight of destruction, seeing lives shattered who are looking for hope. We acknowledge the depths of human despair and the feeling of being cut down to a stump.<br><br>Yet, we cling to Your defiant promise through the prophet Isaiah: that from the dead stump of Jesse, a Branch will shoot forth—a King, anointed by Your Spirit.<br><br>We praise You for Jesus Christ, the perfect Ruler:<br><br>He is filled with Wisdom and Understanding.<br>He governs with Counsel and Might.<br>He acts with Knowledge and the Fear of the LORD.<br><br>We seek refuge in His leadership because He does not judge by what He sees or hears, but discerns the truth with perfect righteousness. Thank You, Lord Jesus, for seeing us as we truly are, free from prejudice.<br><br>We pray for the fulfillment of Your kingdom, where hostility ceases and peace reigns—where the wolf lies with the lamb, and there is no harm or destruction. May the earth be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.<br><br>Strengthen us to be the people who hold out this saving hope to a world that feels dangerous and prejudiced. May we be witnesses to this King and His promised safe kingdom, until all nations rally to Him.<br><br>In the powerful name of Jesus, our sure hope, we pray. Amen |

| **Mission Partners** | *Berkeley Life Centre*<br><br>_General info:_<br>Berkeley Life Centre desires to see Jesus Christ transforming lives to transform a community. They minister in the south coast in an area where many people are from a low socioeconomic background. People are coming to faith and the church is making a positive impact.<br><br>Lord, we lay the Berkeley community before you. You see the deep need and the pain of this marginalized, low socio-economic area. We pray for every person struggling with disability, depression, chronic disease, low self-esteem, and dementia. We ask for your intervention in the lives of those trapped by high unemployment and the destructive cycles of addiction to drugs, alcohol, and gambling, and for those impacted by domestic violence. Bring peace where there is chaos, and clarity where there is confusion.<br><br>Strengthen the faith of those who have come to know you, who still wrestle with the impact of these issues and the threats of the evil one. Protect their resolve, Lord, and empower them to live out the truth of the Gospel daily.<br><br>We pray for provision for their outreach. Bless the ministry of the Op Shop, that through low-cost, quality items and access to food, we may meet tangible needs and build bridges of trust.<br><br>Father, we ask specifically for the resources to help people improve their lives. We urgently pray for skilled, Christ-centred counsellors to run the life-improving training courses and to facilitate powerful 1:1 discipling. We trust you for the necessary financial resources to cover these costs, knowing that developing these lives is an investment in your Kingdom. |
