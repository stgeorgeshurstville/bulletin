## Collect
Blessed Lord, you have caused all holy scriptures to be written for our learning: grant us so to hear them, read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest them, that, encouraged and supported by your holy Word, we may embrace and always hold fast the joyful hope of everlasting life, which you have given us in our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.

| **From the Passage** | Almighty God, Heavenly Father, we stand before you today acknowledging the weight of your authoritative word, and the tragic consequences of choosing to ignore it. We confess that we often disregard the warnings you provide, whether through scripture, conscience, or circumstance, leading to costly failure.<br><br> We confess that like Israel in Babylon, our ears are often spiritually deaf, tuned instead to the hollow promises of our own idols—the comforts, securities, and approvals that cannot speak and cannot save. For the times we have preferred self-sufficiency over your wisdom, forgive us.<br><br> We thank you for the sending of your Servant, Jesus Christ.<br><br> - Thank you that He was perfectly called, equipped with words that are a sharpened sword and a polished arrow, capable of penetrating the darkness in our hearts and the chaos of the world. <br><br> - Thank you that when His labor felt futile, when He was despised and abhorred by His own nation and the rulers of the world, He did not stop. His reward was not found in public opinion, but solely in you.<br><br> Lord, we ask that you empower us, your people, to follow His example.<br><br> - Deliver us from the captivity of human opinion. When we are called to speak your truth, grant us the courage to persist, even when we feel ignored, rejected, or that our ministry is in vain. May our ultimate reward always be found in your faithful hand and your delight in us.<br><br> - Grant us an attentive ear. Help us to turn away from the idols that deafen us. We surrender our own plans and ask that we might see the world, not according to our limited human viewpoint, but according to your glorious plan of salvation.<br><br> - Use us in the fulfillment of your mission. You declared that restoring Israel was too small a thing, for the ultimate purpose was to make your Servant a light for the Gentiles, that salvation might reach the ends of the earth. As those who have received that light, use us to continue the work started by Christ and continued by His Apostles.<br><br> We celebrate the truth of the Vindication: that the rejection and the cross did not silence Him. We declare that the Kings and Princes of this earth will one day bow down before Jesus, the faithful and chosen Servant. Give us faith to live today in light of that promised victory.<br><br> Help us to be resolute, knowing that your power is unmatched, your promises are true, and your approval is all that we need.<br><br> We pray this in the powerful and vindicated name of the Lord Jesus Christ, your Servant.<br><br> **Amen**.|
