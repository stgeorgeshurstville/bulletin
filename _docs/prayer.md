**Special Items & Events**  
From the passage: Heavenly Father, We come before You today with hearts that long for Your guidance, protection, and care. As we reflect on Psalm 23, we are reminded that You, Lord, are our shepherd. You lead us beside still waters and restore our souls. You guide us on paths of righteousness, not because of our worthiness, but because of Your goodness and mercy. Lord, as we journey into a new year, we recognize that this road is untraveled and unknown to us. Like David, who reflected on the many twists and turns of his life, we acknowledge the challenges, mistakes, and pains of our past. Help us not to sweep these under the carpet but to bring them to You, the One who heals and restores. In the shadow of the darkest valleys, where fear and evil loom large, remind us that You are always with us. Your rod and Your staff, they comfort and protect us. Even in the face of danger, opposition, or our own sin and folly, You remain faithful. You prepare a table for us and anoint us with oil; our cups overflow because of Your grace. Thank You, Lord, that in Jesus, we have the ultimate Shepherd—One who not only leads us but also lays down His life for us. Through Him, we are safe at home in Your presence, forever. Your goodness and mercy follow us all the days of our lives, and we dwell with You for eternity. Father, as we step into this new year, we entrust our journey to You. Be our Shepherd, our Provider, and our Protector. Help us to rest in the knowledge that we are safe in Your arms, even when the path feels uncertain or the road ahead feels hard. In the name of Jesus, our Good Shepherd, we pray. Amen.
