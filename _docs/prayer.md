## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** Let your merciful ears, Lord God, be open to the prayers of your people; and so that they may obtain their petitions, make them to ask such things as will please you; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Dear God, our loving and kind Father, you are full of grace and patience, and you always love us. You are holy and fair, but you never turn away from those who look for you. We feel safe and comforted with you, our God. We trust you with our lives and know your love never fails. As we come to you through Jesus, we ask for your mercy and help with everything we need. Let your Spirit work in us to grow love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
- **Our Purpose**: Sovereign Creator, My greatest concern is to fulfill the purpose for which you have given me: to glorify you and to do good to others. Life holds no value if it is not dedicated to this noble cause. Sadly, many live solely for themselves, pursuing wealth, status and pleasure as if these could bring lasting happiness. But these are false and empty pursuits which only lead to misery. True happiness lies in loving you and striving for holiness. May I never be swayed by the fleeting pleasures and vanities of this world. Help me to see through the illusions of worldly success and pleasure, recognizing that true fulfillment can only be found in a life devoted to your Son. Grant me the grace to remain faithful to you, rejecting sinful pleasures and seeking only your will. Let me always remember that my ultimate happiness and purpose can only be realized in a life lived for you.
- **Mission**: Our gracious Father, thank you for the privilege of calling us to join in your mission. Thank you that under you what we do makes a difference in the world. We pray therefore that you will save those around us and to transform them into the likeness of Jesus. Please use us to make disciples of the nations, love our neighbours. Please Father, glorify yourself, through our labour in your Son. We pray that we will not be consumers but contributors to the ministries that you have called us to. 
- **Sermon**:  Father of our Lord Jesus, We ask You to fill us with the knowledge of Your will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives so that we will live lives worthy of You, Lord, and to please You in every way. As we are filled by the Gospel, may we bear fruit in every good work and grow very deeper in knowing You. We want to keep going and growing. Make us strong with all power according to Your glorious might, so that we may have great endurance and patience. We give joyful thanks to You, Father, for qualifying us to share in the inheritance of Your holy people in the kingdom of light. For You have rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son You love, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. Amen.

## Mission Partner Focus
- **Persecuted Christians:** We thank you for sending Jesus who is sovereign and came to save the world by sacrificing himself. Please give patience and perseverance to those who are being persecuted for the faith whether in Australia through pressure or in other parts of the world through physical persecution like North Korea, Somalia and Libya. May we be a model of what it means to have a calling in this life and a confidence for the next one. May we look to you as the judge and respond with love rather than revenge as we trust that you can make the blood of the martyrs into the seed of the church. You can sign up for more prayer points and updates of persecuted Christians from [Open Doors](vom.com.au/pray-for-the-persecuted-church/)
- and [Voice of the Martyrs](https://vom.com.au/prayer/).
- **Compassion:** Jesus came to seek and to save the lost. You tell us that true religion is to visit orphans and widows in their affliction. May Compassion Australia seek to release children from poverty in Jesus’ name. May we do what we can to love children and their families so that they will mature physically, mentally, socially and most importantly spiritually. May we prayerfully invest in the lives of the children in Sumba Indonesia and see a whole region won and living for God. We praise you that over 100 children are sponsored by members of our church. May we keep praying, communicating and supporting them and their family. May these children have enough sustenance, health and support as they participate in the program and activities. May you give wisdom to our 11 partner churches in the area to love and care for the children and prepare for the mission trip in February 2025.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **World:** We pray that you will lead the nations of the world in the ways of righteousness and peace. Please guide our rulers in wisdom and justice. May there be tranquillity so that we can live godly and holy lives and people can come to the knowledge of the truth. May we submit to those you’ve placed in authority and ultimately to your reign and rule. May people live and long for the new world to come rather than seek to gain the world and forfeit our souls. 
- **Redevelopment:** Our Gracious God and Heavenly Father, You know our needs. You have richly provided and we know that you will continue to provide what we need for the mission that you have called us to. May our faithful stewardship bear witness to the love of Jesus Christ in our lives. We pray this in the name of the one who is building us into a spiritual house for a holy priesthood and to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to you.
- **Sunday Services**: Thank you heavenly Father for our ascended King. Thank you for the gifts of apostles, evangelists, pastors, teachers, service leaders, musicians, bible readers, welcomers and all those who serve us. We pray that you will use their service for the building up of the church and the spurring of each other to love and good deeds. May we all be united and mature in the faith and in the knowledge of your Son.  
- **Staff and Parish Council:** We praise you for the leaders you’ve appointed over us. May they love and care for the church of God which you obtained with your own blood. May they prayerfully set forth the life giving word through their lives and teaching. Clothe them with holiness, zeal and servant heartedness. We pray for our wardens and parish councillors, may they have wisdom, insight and passion to see our church family be spiritually transformed for your glory. Please use them to help us stay focused and accountable with the resources you’ve given us. 
- **English Congregations:** May we have a secure attachment to Jesus especially as we understand him to be the great high priest, true passover lamb and the bringer of the new covenant this term. We thank you for the growth in numbers and newcomers. May we be welcoming and other people focused as we strive to be mature in Christ. May we keep encouraging each other on Sundays but also during the week.
- **Families:** We remember the families of our church community. We pray that despite the busyness, you will be an ever presence and comfort to them. Please help kids and their families to set the right priorities, the discipline to say ‘no’. May our love for and devotion to you be our greatest desire. Help parents and spiritual uncles and aunties to impart the knowledge of you and of your love; and children to respond with love and obedience. We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
