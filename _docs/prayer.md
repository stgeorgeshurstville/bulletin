## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** Almighty God, you have given your only Son to be for us both a sacrifice for sin and also an example of godly life; give us grace that we may always thankfully receive the immeasurable benefit of his sacrifice, and also daily endeavour to follow in the blessed steps of his most holy life; who now lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for evermore. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Loving and compassionate Father, You are full of grace and kindness, patient and overflowing with love and faithfulness. Your holiness and fairness shine brightly, yet you never turn away from those who seek you. We find our safety and comfort in you, our God. Our lives are entrusted to your care, and we trust in your unfailing love. O faithful God, as we come before your throne of grace through Jesus, we humbly ask for your mercy and grace to meet our every need. May your Spirit work within us, producing in us the beautiful fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In the precious name of your beloved Son, we pray. Amen.
- **Growing Up**: Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day. 
- **Confession**: Dear God, our Father in heaven, You are always loving and good, But we’re not. We haven;t loved You and others like we should. We do things we know are wrong, And we don't do things that are right. We're really sad and sorry. Please forgive us because of Jesus. By your Spirit help us to love You and everyone else, and to live in a way that honours You. Amen.

## Mission Related Prayer Points

- **Berkeley Life Centre:** Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain times and places so that they may find you. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast their burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. May people who are suffering from domestic violence, dealing with the police and justice system, suffering from mental illness, experiencing difficult and dysfunctional relationships and navigating health issues know that Jesus has come for all including sinners and to seek and save the lost. Please sustain Rev. Wayne Pickford and the team as they lead the church to be a light and witness in their community. We praise you for providing Samantha Trotter who is helping with the womens and children ministry. Praise God for the opportunity to go into Berkeley and Berkeley West Public to teach Scripture. Please pray that Peter Kell’s (ex Board chair) health will improve and a suitable replacement be found. May enough money be raised to buy the building where the Op Shop is. May the Frozen Meals Ministry be an avenue for the church to care for those struggling and hear the good news. Praise God that the first community outreach BBQ went well. May Glenn grow in his conviction, character and competence as he continues The Well Training Program. 
- **English classes:** We praise you for the many people groups that are in Hurstville including from Nepal, Latin America, Mongolia and China. May we have a heart for them to settle and live well in Australia and more importantly to find their true residence in Jesus. May the teachers and volunteers be a model of love and good works as they teach people about Jesus and English. Sustain and go with us including the new volunteers. May you keep sustaining this community during the break. We praise you for Gayle who will be finishing up as a teacher (after 11 years of teaching) and moves to Berry.  
- **Evangelism Teams and Programs:** Gracious Lord, our neighbours are lost and far away from you. We long for the opportunity to proclaim your name. Please give us the eyes to see those whom you have placed before us. Whenever I open my mouth, may words be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel. We pray that as the seeds of the gospel are scattered and planted, that they would land on good soil. Please make them bear fruit, Father. Scare away the crows. Crush the rocks. Strangle the weeds. Instead, give us rich healthy soil ready to receive the seeds of the gospel. May we find people to read the word with 121. In Jesus’ name, we pray.
