## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** Almighty God, we pray that the course of this world may be so peaceably ordered through your guidance that your church may joyfully serve you in all godly quietness; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Loving and compassionate Father, You are full of grace and kindness, patient and overflowing with love and faithfulness. Your holiness and fairness shine brightly, yet you never turn away from those who seek you. We find our safety and comfort in you, our God. Our lives are entrusted to your care, and we trust in your unfailing love. O faithful God, as we come before your throne of grace through Jesus, we humbly ask for your mercy and grace to meet our every need. May your Spirit work within us, producing in us the beautiful fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In the precious name of your beloved Son, we pray. Amen.
- **Refuge:** Lord, Whose power and wisdom are beyond measure, guide my path so that nothing may hinder or discourage me, nor obstruct the progress of your work. Protect me from strife and evil, and keep me from pursuing my own foolish plans. Lead me in the path of duty and grant me success only in endeavors blessed by you. Let me dwell in you, shielded from all harm and temptation, under the shadow of your protection. I acknowledge my complete dependence on you for support, guidance and comfort. Strengthen me with your Spirit, enabling me to continually move forward in the work you have entrusted to me. I offer everything I have and am to you—my name, my family, my talents, my successes, my present, my future and my ultimate destiny. Take them all, for I am yours, now and forever. Amen. 
- **Mission:** Our gracious Father, thank you for the privilege of calling us to join in your mission. Thank you that under you what we do makes a difference in the world. We pray therefore that you will save those around us and to transform them into the likeness of Jesus. Please use us to make disciples of the nations, love our neighbours. Please Father, glorify yourself, through our labour in your Son. We pray that we will not be consumers but contributors to the ministries that you have called us to. 
- **Sermon:**  As we look at the history of God’s people (especially in the book of Jeremiah), we mourn for how they have treated you, your promises and your word. We realise that they rightly deserve judgement. We praise you for being just. We praise you for being so sovereign that you can even use pagan nations to accomplish your purposes whilst still judging all evil doers and nations. We praise you for being faithful to your promises and bringing righteousness through Jesus who is from the line of King David. May we live as people of hope knowing that the enemy has been defeated, the Spirit has been poured out and New Jerusalem is waiting. Amen.

## Mission Partner Focus

- **Mission Partner Focus (June):** Each month, we’ve been focusing on a mission partner and their ministry. This year, we’ve focused on our Nepali ministry, Compassion and JC. Our focus for this month is Mellisa Wang. She is seeking to make disciples at the University of Adelaide.
  - Prayer: We praise you for the people from different nations coming to Adelaide University. May they not only settle well but more importantly find their citizenship in heaven. We praise you for giving Mellisa the desire and means to share the gospel with others. May the 6 females she is reading the Bible with keep being a source of encouragement and a way to grow each other in maturity. May the upcoming Mid Year Conference help people to understand their union with Christ more. We thank you that students have heard about and some have trusted in Jesus. We praise you for helping Ricardo to realise that salvation is a gift. We praise you for his desire to invite others to know Jesus and the opportunity he is having to read the Bible with a Hindu. We praise you for people like Mel who wants to grow in Christ. Please keep sustaining Mellisa in godliness, strength and wisdom as she keeps sharing the good news. Help her to keep realising that a Christian is about who we are in Jesus rather than what we do for him.
  - Next Steps: You can sign up for Mellisa’s newsletter to be updated and find out about other ways you can partner with her. Please speak to someone from the mission subcommittee if you have any questions.
- **Moore College:** We thank you for providing stewards to equip your saints for the work of ministry. Praise God for using Moore Theological College to encourage Christians to be more like Jesus and share about Him in Sydney and the world. Pray that God will keep the board, faculty and students godly, prayerful and other people centred (more information [here](https://moore.edu.au/missions).

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Volunteers:** Everlasting God, we give thanks for the many volunteers who have been faithfully serving in different ministries at church especially in this challenging period of time. Please strengthen and sustain them with patience and understanding that they may love and care for your people. Please grant that together they may follow Jesus Christ, offer you their given gifts and talents, and build up the church, the body of Christ.
- **Hurstville**: We pray that the 30,000 people in Hurstville, with many from different cultures and countries, will come to know Jesus as their Lord and Saviour. May we have a heart for the people you have placed around us. May we be lights in our neighbourhood which is in darkness and filled with anxiety and uncertainty. May we be mindful of the changing demographics and seek to share the gospel with them. We commit to you the Nepali community and ask that many will come to know Christ through the ministry of Bijaya and our church. May Chris Minns (NSW Premier and Legislative Assembly Member for Kogarah), Linda Burney (House Representative for Barton), David Coleman (House Representative for Banks) and Nick Katris (Mayor) know God as the one with ultimate authority and serve and lead with love, justice and wisdom. 
- **Discipleship Groups**: We praise you for the opportunity to spur each other to love and good deeds. May the seed of God’s word grow as we plant and water. May we know who Jesus is as we grow in our secure attachment with him. Help us to be vulnerable, repentant and Christ like as we inwardly digest, delight in and do his word. 
- **Pastoral Care Team**: Father, you sent your Son to heal the brokenhearted. May we cast our burdens and anxieties upon you knowing that you can sympathise with our weaknesses and care for us. May the peace of God sustain us as we bear the hope of the gospel, point people to heaven and carry each other’s burdens. 
- **People with Disabilities**: Thank you that all people are made in your image. We pray for those with disabilities that they would know their true value as your image-bearers. May your love in Jesus heal them from any experience of rejection and pain. We pray that they will know of Jesus’ sufficiency in their experience of chronic pain and suffering. Forgive us for the ways we have often treated people with disabilities. Please help us to be like Jesus in welcoming all people and going out to love, seek and save the lost. Please open our eyes to see them as whole human beings and the seemingly weaker parts of the body are indispensable. Please help us to learn and listen from those with disabilities and their carers. May the world see Jesus through our love for one another. We look forward to the day when Jesus returns and his people will be given sinless resurrection bodies. Amen.
- **Support Ministries**: Everlasting God, we give thanks for the many volunteers who have been faithfully serving in different ministries at church both up front and behind the scenes. Please strengthen and sustain them with patience, understanding and joy to love and care. May you use their gifts and talents to build up the church which is the body of Christ. We ask this for the communication, cleaning, flower, bulletin, meals, AV, sound, music, bible readin, maintenance, prayer, set up, pack up, welcoming, technology and other teams. May people come to know Jesus as the Son of Man who came to serve and not to be served through our words and actions. May we all see that we have been given the manifestation of the Spirit to build up one another.
