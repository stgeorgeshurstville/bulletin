| **From the Passage** | Three-in-one, one-in-three, God of our salvation: Heavenly Father, blessed Son, and eternal Spirit. We worship you as one Being, one essence, and one God in three distinct persons, for bringing sinners to know you and your kingdom. <br><br> O Father, you have loved us and sent Jesus to redeem us. O Jesus, you have loved us and taken on our human nature; you shed your blood to wash away our sins and worked out a perfect righteousness to cover our unworthiness. O Holy Spirit, you have loved us and entered our hearts; you planted eternal life within us and revealed the glories of Jesus.

<br><br> Three persons and one God: We bless and praise you for love so undeserved, so beyond words, so wonderful, and so powerful to save the lost and raise them to glory.

<br><br> Father, we thank you that in your overflowing grace, you have given us to Jesus to be his own—his sheep, his jewels, and his treasure. O Jesus, we thank you that in your overflowing grace, you have accepted us, united yourself to us, and bound us to yourself forever. O Holy Spirit, we thank you that in your overflowing grace, you have shown us that Jesus is our salvation.

<br><br> You have planted faith within us, settled our stubborn hearts, and made us one with him forever.

<br><br> O Father, you are seated on the throne to hear our prayers. O Jesus, your hand is outstretched to receive our requests. O Holy Spirit, you are ready to help us in our weakness, to show us our need, to give us the words to say, to pray within us, and to strengthen us so we do not give up in our prayers.

<br><br> O Triune God, who commanded the universe into being: you have commanded us to ask for the things that concern your kingdom and our lives. Let us live and pray as a people baptized into the threefold Name. Amen.
