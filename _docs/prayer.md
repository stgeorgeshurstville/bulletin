## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.

- **Collect:** Lord, give your people grace to withstand the temptations of the world, the flesh, and the devil, and with pure hearts and minds to follow you the only God; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

- **Growing Up:** Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day.

## Weekly Prayer Points
- **The Lord will raise the workers for children ministry at 4pm.**
- **Mid Autumn Festival.** We thank you that you created times and seasons and that we can celebrate the Mid Autumn Festival in Australia. Please help us to use this opportunity to invite our Mandarin-speaking non-Christian friends and family to come and hear the good news of Jesus. We pray that our church family may be welcoming of the new people who come and have your wisdom to know how to share Jesus with them.
- **The Voice Referendum:** Gracious Lord, the Father from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, we pray for our nation. We lament the damage done to the original inhabitants of this land, since European settlement, including the loss of life, land and language. We recognise sins committed and harm done. We praise you that you have built your church among the First Peoples of this land and we rejoice to be brothers and sisters in Christ with them. Hear our prayer as together we consider the referendum on recognition and the Voice to Parliament. Preserve us in love, respect and mutual service. Give us a spirit of wisdom and discernment as we cast our votes. Father, whatever is decided, we beg you for clear and lasting progress in addressing inequality and closing the gap for First Nations peoples. Bless Australia, we pray, as the gospel is proclaimed, that we may be reconciled to you and to each other through him who died for all, Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour, in whose name we pray, Amen.
- **Libya Floods:** May God sustain the energy, efforts, faith, and generosity of the church volunteer team and that His name may be glorified through their services. May emergency assistance reach those who need it and for the community to move towards recovery. May God’s comfort and peace be on all who have lost loved ones, suffered material losses, and are undergoing trauma and grief. In the midst of hardship and suffering, may God’s sovereign control and love may be evident, and that people will turn to Jesus for hope.

## Mission Partners
- **Berkeley Life Centre:** Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain times and places so that they may find you. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast their burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. May people who are suffering from domestic violence, dealing with the police and justice system, suffering from mental illness, experiencing difficult and dysfunctional relationships and navigating health issues will know that Jesus has come for the sinners and to seek and save the lost. Please sustain Rev. Wayne Pickford and the team as they lead the church to be a light and witness in their community. We praise you for providing Samantha Trotter who will help with the womens and children ministry later in the year. Please pray that Peter Kell’s (Board) health will improve and a suitable replacement be found. Pray for a scripture teacher. Pray for enough money to be raised to buy the building where the Op Shop is. 
- **CanCare:** Father God, we thank you that you know what it means to face trials and pain and that you can sympathise with our weaknesses. We ask that you’ll use CanCare to support people and their family and friends who are or have suffered the ravages of cancer. Please give them wisdom in how to support this community especially during this uncertain period of COVID. May God bless those suffering from cancer with his peace. May God's salvation come to those who have yet to accept Jesus.
- **Empowering Everyone with English in Jesus’ Name:** We praise you for the many people groups that are in Hurstville. May we have a heart for them to settle and live well in Australia and more importantly to find their true residence in the New Heaven. May the teachers and volunteers be a model of love and good works as they teach people about Jesus and English. 
- **Evangelism Teams and Programs:** Gracious Lord, our neighbours are lost and far away from you. We long for the opportunity to proclaim your name. Please give us the eyes to see those whom you have placed before us. Whenever I open my mouth, may words be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel. We pray that as the seeds of the gospel are scattered and planted, that they would land on good soil. Please make them bear fruit, Father. Scare away the crows. Crush the rocks. Strangle the weeds. Instead, give us rich healthy soil ready to receive the seeds of the gospel. In Jesus’ name, we pray.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Australia:** Guide with your wisdom and power the leaders of the nation, so that everyone may live in peace and mutual trust, sharing with justice the resources of the earth. Give the people of this land a spirit of unselfishness, compassion, and fairness in public and private life.

We pray that you would give our leaders wisdom and a fear of you. We pray that many in our nation who are suffering may find hope, peace, comfort, life and purpose in the gospel of your Son. May Anthony Albanese and Chris Minns lead Australia and NSW well in a time of change and anxiety. 
- **Nursing Homes and Seniors Ministries**: We thank you Father, that our hope in Jesus cannot be taken from us. We remember those who are living in residential care, those who are living at home and receiving care, those who are providing the care, and their families.
