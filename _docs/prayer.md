## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:**  Lord of all power and might, the author and giver of all good things, graft in our hearts the love of your Name, increase in us true religion, nourish us with all goodness, and so by your mercy keep us; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Dear God, our loving and kind Father, you are full of grace and patience, and you always love us. You are holy and fair, but you never turn away from those who look for you. We feel safe and comforted with you, our God. We trust you with our lives and know your love never fails. As we come to you through Jesus, we ask for your mercy and help with everything we need. Let your Spirit work in us to grow love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
- **Growing Up:** Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day. 
- **Sermon:** Reflect on what your needs are at the moment (daily bread, forgiveness, relationship etc). Then spend a moment thinking about what other people need. Spend a moment asking Jesus to help you/people with those needs.

## Mission Partner Focus

- **Persecuted Christians:** We thank you for sending Jesus who is sovereign and came to save the world by sacrificing himself. Please give patience and perseverance to those who are being persecuted for the faith whether in Australia through pressure or in other parts of the world through physical persecution like North Korea, Somalia and Libya. May we be an model of what it means to have a calling in this life and a confidence for the next one. May we look to you as the judge and respond with love rather than revenge as we trust that you can make the blood of the martyrs into the seed of the church. You can sign up for more prayer points and updates of persecuted Christians from Open Doors [here](https://www.opendoors.org.au/get-involved/prayer/) and Voice of the Martyrs [here](https://vom.com.au/pray/)
- **Barkley Life:** Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain times and places so that they may find you. We ask that you’ll sustain and use our mission partners to make and mature disciples of all nations. May we be active, involved, enthusiastic, generous and prayerful members. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast our burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. Please sustain Rev. Wayne Pickford and his team as they lead the church to be a light and witness in their community.
