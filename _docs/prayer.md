**Mission and Vision** 
<br><br> *Shine for Jesus, Everywhere, Anytime:*  
Thank You for calling us to be Your people and for giving our church a vision to shine for Jesus—everywhere, anytime. Strengthen us to live out this mission with love, humility, and courage. Help us reach our community and the nations with the light of Christ, building one another up in faith and serving with joy. May all we do bring glory to Your name and draw others to Your saving grace.
In Jesus’ name we pray, Amen.


**Global and Nation** 
<br><br> *Local*:  
We thank you Lord  for placing us in the heart of Hurstville—a community rich in culture and diversity. We pray for Your peace, justice, and love to dwell among our neighbours. Open doors for us to share the hope of Jesus with people from every nation and language. Strengthen local families, schools, and businesses; bring comfort to the lonely, the sick, and the struggling. May our church be a light in this city, reflecting Christ’s compassion and truth in all we do. Amen.


**Mission Partners**
<br><br> *Mathys and PNG*  
General info: There are >800 languages spoken in Papua New Guinea, but only 13 have complete bibles. Calvin and Ruth work alongside Papua New Guineans in roles that support the ongoing ministry of bible translation. Calvin is an aircraft maintenance engineer, in order to provide transport and logistics support for bible translators. Ruth provides training for the bible translators, so that locals can take the lead in this work.
