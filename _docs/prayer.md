Almighty God, you have given your only Son to be for us both a sacrifice for sin and also an example of godly life; give us grace that we may always thankfully receive the immeasurable benefit of his sacrifice, and also daily endeavour to follow in the blessed steps of his most holy life; who now lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for evermore. Amen.

| From the Passage | Dear Father, Thank You for raising Jesus from the dead. Thank You that disappointment, death, and despair are not the end of the story. Like the disciples, we are slow to understand, quick to fear, and often sad. But thank You that Jesus came back to us—not as a ghost or symbol—but as our living Saviour. Please open our minds and hearts to truly see Him. Give us hope in loss, joy in suffering, and courage to share His love. Make us not just committed Christians, but crucified ones—ready to live for You. The world needs the joy that Jesus brings. Please give us opportunities to share this joy with everyone around us this Easter. In Jesus’ name, Amen. |

| Myanmar | Dear Lord, You are the God of all comfort, sovereign over all creation. We come to you today with heavy hearts for all those affected by the earthquake in Myanmar and Thailand.
We ask for your protection for all impacted by the earthquake, especially those needing to be rescued, medical assistance, and emergency aid. We pray for those displaced, injured, and mourning. We pray for comfort and strength for those who have lost loved ones, homes, possessions, and livelihood. Please help them as they look to you in their times of trouble. Hear their cry for help in their time of affliction. Help them to find hope in Jesus, in the depths of their despair. We pray for those involved in the rescue operation and emergency efforts. We pray for the ministry of the Anglican church in Myanmar, as they bring hope and help to those made vulnerable by this disaster. Give them the physical and emotional fortitude to continue their selfless efforts. May the name of Jesus be praised through their efforts. Please be with Archbishop Stephan Than, Bishop David Nyi Nyi of Mandalay Diocese, Bishop Saw John Wilme of Toungoo Diocese, along with their clergy and laity, and the Disaster Relief Committee as they manage the relief effort and demonstrate the love of Jesus to those affected. In Jesus' name, we pray.Amen.
