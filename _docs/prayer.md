**Prayer**

Stir up, Lord, the wills of your faithful people, that they may produce abundantly the fruit of good works, and receive your abundant reward; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

**Special Prayer Points**
- **Prayer from this week’s passage:** Dear God, in your kindness and generosity, you have given us everything. We have been deceived into thinking that there’s not enough, that you won’t provide, that we need to compete and hoard to be safe. We worry about many things. We hurt ourselves and others. Please forgive us. Thank you that you have created a world of abundance. Thank you that you are still graciously providing to us. Thank you that in Jesus we have the most important thing - to be your children. When we worry, remind us of your promises in Jesus. Help us to make your glory our greatest ambition and our Lord Jesus our greatest treasure. Amen. 
- **Mission week and Christmas events:** Think of someone who needs to know Jesus and pray for them.

Cancare: Heavenly Father, we praise You for Your mercy and kindness. You understand what it means to face trials and suffering, and You sympathize with our weaknesses. We thank You for using CanCare to support cancer patients, both current and former, as well as their families and friends. Through Christ's love, they serve and walk alongside those navigating the challenging journey of cancer. Lord, we ask for Your continued guidance upon the CanCare team. Grant them wisdom, understanding, and unity of heart as they care for this community. May the peace of our Lord Jesus rest upon every cancer patient during this Christmas season, bringing comfort and hope.

 Evangelism Teams: Lord, we thank You for the abundant opportunities You have given us this Christmas season to serve You and proclaim Your gospel. We commit all the gatherings and activities in December into Your hands, asking for Your protection and guidance in every detail. May these arrangements glorify Your name and touch many hearts to receive Your love and salvation. We pray for the Mission Week from December 8 to 15 that You would inspire more brothers and sisters to participate eagerly. Let these events become opportunities to share the gospel, bless the community, and build each other up in faith. We also commit the Christmas Market on December 14 to You, asking that it serve as a bridge to connect with the community, introduce them to the church, and open doors for sharing the gospel. May this event also strengthen unity among the brothers and sisters as they serve together with one heart. We pray for the outdoor picnic service and church dinner on December 15 that these gatherings would display the unity of the church and become a testimony to Your glory. Lastly, we pray for the Mandarin Christmas carol service on December 24 and the Christmas Day services on December 25. Please prepare the hearts of all who attend, especially new friends, that they may hear the good news of the gospel, feel Your love and presence, and find eternal hope in Jesus Christ. 

**Confession:**

Most merciful God, we humbly admit that we need your help. We confess that we have wandered from your way: we have done wrong, and we have failed to do what is right. You alone can save us. Have mercy on us: wipe out our sins and teach us to forgive others. Bring forth in us the fruit of the Spirit that we may live as disciples of Christ. This we ask in the name of Jesus our Saviour. Amen.

**Assurance:**

For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life (John 3:16). 

God is slow to anger and full of compassion. He forgives all who humbly repent and trust in his Son as Saviour and Lord. There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.  Amen.

**Consecration**

On the night he was betrayed, Jesus took bread and, when he had given thanks, he broke it, then gave it to his disciples, saying, ‘Take and eat; this is my body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me.’ In the same way after the meal, Jesus took the cup and, when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, ‘Drink from this, all of you. This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.’
