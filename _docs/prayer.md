### Church Ministries ###
**CanCare:** Heavenly Father, we praise You for Your mercy and kindness. You understand the trials and suffering we face and are compassionate toward our weaknesses. We thank You for using CanCare to support those who are battling or have overcome cancer, along with their families and friends. Through Christ’s love, they serve and walk alongside them on this challenging journey. Lord, we ask that You continue to lead the CanCare team. Grant them wisdom, discernment, and a spirit of unity as they care for this community. This year, CanCare is committed to promoting education on life and death, with the hope of fostering a more positive understanding of this topic among the Chinese community. May it lead to deeper reflection on the reality and meaning of death, and in turn, a more holistic approach to cherishing and valuing life. We pray that You would guide and bless all aspects of this work. 

**Evangelism teams:** Gracious Lord, we thank You for the opportunities You have given us to proclaim Your name to those who are lost and far from You. Please continue to open our eyes to see the people You place before us, and grant us boldness and wisdom to share the mystery of the Gospel without fear. Lord, prepare the hearts of those we encounter. Remove the barriers that hinder the Gospel, and instead, create rich, healthy soil in their hearts, ready to receive the good news of Jesus Christ. Strengthen and unite our team as we labour together for Your kingdom. May the words we speak and the lives we live reflect Your love and truth, drawing people closer to You.

**Nursing home:** Dear Heavenly Father, You are the God of grace and hope. You understand every challenge and burden that each elderly person carries in their heart. We ask for Your mighty hand to touch their lives and bring comfort to their souls. Help them to turn their hearts fully to You, trust in You completely, and find true peace and blessings in Your presence. For those living in nursing homes or requiring special care at home, may they deeply experience the love of Christ surrounding them. Lord, use every member of the care and visitation team as a channel of Your love. May those they visit feel the joy and encouragement of genuine fellowship and the fullness of love shared among them.

### Groups in Church ###
**Cantonese Congregation:** Lord, we pray for our brothers and sisters of the Cantonese congregation, asking for continued stability and spiritual growth in every aspect of our community. May Your Word take deep root in our hearts, and may our lives be shaped by Your truth and love. Help us to live out this year’s vision: Shine for Christ — Everywhere, Anytime, and to reflect His love and truth in our daily lives. We also pray for unity among us as one body in Christ, serving together with one heart and spirit. We pray for the Gospel class that started on April 6, may seekers continue to encounter Jesus through Your Word and come to know Your salvation and love. As we enter the Easter season, we thank You for the resurrection of our Lord Jesus. May this season renew our hope and deepen our faith. We pray that our Easter events will proclaim the gospel clearly and lead many to know the Risen Christ.

**Volunteers:** Gracious God, we humbly come before You in prayer today to offer our immense gratitude for your provision with our faithful volunteers at church.May Your Spirit bless them with continual guidance as they faithfully serve you and your people. We ask You to bestow upon them resilience, daring, and humility. Let joy, peace, and satisfaction be upon the good work that they do.Inspire and motivate them to persist through trying circumstances, steadfast in their dedication to serving  those around them. We are deeply grateful for these volunteers, whose shining radiance reflects the profound beauty and compassion of Your love.In Jesus’ name, we pray, Amen.
