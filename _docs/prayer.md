Almighty God, you alone can order the unruly wills and passions of sinful men: grant to your people that they may love what you command and desire what you promise, that so, among the many and varied changes of the world, our hearts may surely there be fixed where true joys are to be found; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

| From the Passage | Heavenly Father,

Thank You for not remaining distant, but for sending Your Son, Jesus, to reveal Your love and draw us into it. Thank You that in Him, we see Your true self. Open our eyes to behold Your love more clearly each day.

Without Your work and Your grace, those we meet remain in darkness, just as we once did. Have mercy on our world, Lord, as You have had mercy on us.

Free us to speak, not out of obligation, but from the overflow of encountering Your light and receiving Your love. Cast out our fears by filling us with deeper love for You and for the lost. Give us wisdom to know what to say and when to speakâ€”and humility to listen when silence is needed.

May our lives and words point always to Jesus, in whose name we pray, Amen.

| Mission Partners  | Mathys and PNG: General info: There are >800 languages spoken in Papua New Guinea, but only 13 have complete bibles. Calvin and Ruth work alongside Papua New Guineans in roles that support the ongoing ministry of bible translation. Calvin is an aircraft maintenance engineer, in order to provide transport and logistics support for bible translators. Ruth provides training for the bible translators, so that locals can take the lead in this work. Currently on home assignment in Melbourne. Give thanks for being able to enjoy a family holiday. Pray for them as they present and speak at churches. Pray for God to continue providing financial partnerships as they determine a new field budget and aim to return to PNG in July. Pray that they can trust God to be content and be good stewards of his generous provision. Pray for their children (Jakob as he settles into new student accommodation, and for Andreas/Petra as they continue schooling online) |
|Special Items & Events | KYCK, Easter markets, Lord, we thank You for the opportunity to reach into the community through the Easter night market and to share the joyful message of Your resurrection.

We ask that You bless each brother and sister who served, and continue to work in the hearts of those who were reached. Draw them to know You. Please bless the follow-up efforts, and may the seeds of the gospel bear fruit in Your perfect timing. To You be all the glory. Collection for Myanmar earthquake recovery aid (ARDFA) |
