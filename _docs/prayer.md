**Prayer**
Merciful God, you have made all people and hate nothing that you have made, nor do you desire the death of a sinner but rather that he should be converted and live: have mercy on your ancient people the Jews, and all who do not know you, or who deny the faith of Christ crucified. Take from them all ignorance, hardness of heart, and contempt of your word; and bring them home to your fold, blessed Lord, so that they may become one flock under one shepherd, Jesus Christ our Lord; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.



## Week 5 (Fifth Sunday of the month)

### From the passage ###
**From Matthew 13:**
Almighty and Gracious Father, 

We come before you acknowledging that we often deceive ourselves. We trust in our own goodness, our own sacrifices, and forget that what you desire is an obedient heart. Lord, cleanse us from the inside out by the blood of Jesus. We confess that our hearts are so easily drawn to pride, self-righteousness, and appearances. Like the Canaanite woman, we come to you with empty hands, knowing that only your mercy and grace can save us. Give us eyes to recognise our need and the faith to cling to Jesus. May we not hide behind religious acts but shine your true glory in Jesus to the world.

Thank you that in Jesus, even the most unclean can be washed and welcomed. 

In his name, we pray. Amen.
