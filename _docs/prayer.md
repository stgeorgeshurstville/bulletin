| **From the Passage** | **Gracious God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,** <br>We come to You as those who need true comfort — not the shallow comforts of this world, but the strong comfort of Your Word. You know our fears, burdens, guilt, and sins. Thank You that You speak to us not with indifference or crushing judgment, but with mercy and compassion.<br><br>**Your Word stands forever**, even as our words — and the words spoken about us — fade like grass. Teach us to trust Your voice above every other voice: above fear, accusation, the world’s judgments, and our own restless hearts.<br><br>**Almighty God**, we praise You that You hold the universe in Your hands. The nations are a drop in a bucket, dust on the scales. You direct all things toward Your wise and good purposes, even when we cannot see it.<br><br>**Father, as we wait for Your glory to be revealed, give us what we need most:**<br>Strength by Your Spirit in our inner being, so that Christ may dwell in our hearts through faith.<br>Power to grasp the width, length, height, and depth of Christ’s love.<br>Grace to persevere in holiness, to wait with patience, to love without limits, and to comfort others with the comfort You give us.<br><br>And as we wait for Christ’s return, may we run and not grow weary; walk and not faint.<br><br>We ask this in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord — the One who comes to comfort, forgive, and carry His people.<br>**Amen**.

|**Special Items & Events**| **A Prayer for Hong Kong in the Wake of the Tai Po Fires**<br><br>Our heavenly Father, creator of all things and the Lord over every nation, we cry out to you in this moment of deep grief as devastating fires have swept through the high-rise towers of Tai Po.<br><br>Our hearts ache for those who have lost loved ones, for those still searching for family and friends, and for all who have lost homes, possessions, and memories in the flames.
Father, in your mercy, restrain the forces of nature from further destruction; in your mercy protect and preserve human life.<br><br>Guard the firefighters, emergency personnel, and rescue workers who have stepped into danger to save others. Strengthen them as they face unbearable heat, falling debris, and scenes of great sorrow. Give wisdom and compassion to authorities as they support survivors, investigate the causes, and arrange shelter for the displaced. Bring comfort and healing to all who are traumatised, grieving, or in shock.<br><br>Lord, we plead for your mercy on this grieving community. Bring relief to those still waiting for news. Draw near to the elderly, the vulnerable, and those who escaped with nothing. Surround them with your people offering care, presence, and hope.<br><br>We pray for justice and truth amid the questions surrounding this tragedy. May wrongdoing be brought to light, and may future lives be protected through wise and courageous action.<br><br>Father, you are the God who “heals the broken-hearted and binds up their wounds.”
In your compassion, pour out your healing upon Hong Kong. Restore what has been lost. Renew this community with your strength. And in the midst of devastation, may people find refuge in the everlasting hope of your Son, who died and rose again for our deliverance.<br><br>We bring these requests before your throne, trusting in your mercy and power,
in the name of Jesus,<br>**Amen.**
