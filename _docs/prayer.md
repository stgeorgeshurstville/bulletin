Almighty and everlasting God, whose will it is to restore all things in your well-beloved Son, the King of kings and Lord of lords: Mercifully grant that the peoples of the earth, divided and enslaved by sin, may be freed and brought together under his most gracious rule; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.

| **From the Passage** | Gracious Father, You are the God who saves nations and the God who hears the quiet cry of the sick and fearful. <br><br>Like Hezekiah, we confess that our faith is often mixed — bold one moment, fragile the next. Have mercy on us.<br><br>Keep us alert to the dangers around us, not only loud threats but the quiet seduction of comfort. Wake us from spiritual sleep. Guard our hearts from pride, from self-centredness, and from seeking the world’s approval more than Your pleasure.<br><br>Teach us to number our days. Use the time You’ve given us for Your glory, for the good of others, and for the sake of those who don’t yet know Christ.<br><br>Thank You for Jesus, the faithful Son of David — steadfast where we are weak, obedient where we falter, victorious where we fail. Help us trust Him, follow Him, and shine for Him everywhere, anytime.<br><br>In His name we pray,<br> **Amen.**|
