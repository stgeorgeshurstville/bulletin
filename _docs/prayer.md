**Prayer**

Lord Jesus Christ, at your first coming you sent your messenger to prepare the way before you: grant that the ministers and stewards of your mysteries may likewise make ready your way, by turning the hearts of the disobedient to the ways of the righteous, that at your second coming to judge the world we may be found an acceptable people in your sight; for you live and reign with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever. Amen.


**Special Prayer Points**
- **Prayer from this weekâ€™s passage:** Our Holy and loving Father, we are quick to speak and slow to listen. We are quick to get angry and slow to be understanding. We find faults in others and are blind to our own. We are blinded to the depth of our poverty by our sin. We are horrified by what we have done to others.  Thank you that Jesus reveals to us our blind self righteousness. Thank you that when we ask you for mercy and forgiveness, when we seek your righteousness, you hear and answer. We thank you for Jesus our righteousness. Help us by your Spirit to change everyday that we may be more and more like Jesus and in all things bring glory to you. Amen. 
- **Mission week and Christmas events:** Think of someone who needs to know Jesus and pray for them.
