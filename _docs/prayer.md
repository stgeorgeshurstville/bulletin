| Church Ministries | CanCare:<br>Heavenly Father, we praise You for Your mercy and kindness. You understand the trials and suffering we face and are compassionate toward our weaknesses. We thank You for using CanCare to support those who are battling or have overcome cancer, along with their families and friends. Through Christâ€™s love, they serve and walk alongside them on this challenging journey. Lord, we ask that You continue to lead the CanCare team. Grant them wisdom and a spirit of unity as they care for this community. In just a moment, Your gracious hand has brought CanCare through 18 years of faithful ministry. As the team prepares for the 18th Anniversary Thanksgiving Dinner, we pray that You would grant them wisdom and strength. Please bless all the preparations, and may this event be a powerful testimony that brings glory to Your name.<br><br>Nursing home / Pastoral Care Teams<br>Dear Heavenly Father, You are the God of grace and hope. You understand every challenge and burden that each elderly person carries in their heart. We ask for Your mighty hand to touch their lives and bring comfort to their souls. Help them to turn their hearts fully to You, trust in You completely, and find true peace and blessings in Your presence. For those living in nursing homes or requiring special care at home, may they deeply experience the love of Christ surrounding them. Lord, use every member of the care and visitation team as a channel of Your love. May those they visit feel the joy and encouragement of genuine fellowship and the fullness of love shared among them.|
