## Week H


**From the Passage**
<br><br> Gracious God,
 You are our refuge and strength,
 yet we confess that we often seek safety elsewhere.
 We trust in our plans, possessions, and people
 more than in You.
 We fear losing control more than losing sight of You.
Lord, have mercy.
 We admit we’re reluctant to let You expose our idols,
 because we hold them so tightly.
 But we ask — gently, patiently —
 show us what we’ve trusted instead of You,
 and free us from their grip.
Thank You that Jesus, gentle and lowly,
 does not come to crush but to save;
 not to condemn but to give rest.
 Help us to be still,
 to cease striving,
 and to know that You are God —
 our refuge, our salvation, our peace.
Through Christ our Lord,
Amen.
