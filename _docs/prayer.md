## Collect
Lord Jesus Christ, at your first coming you sent your messenger to prepare the way before you: grant that the ministers and stewards of your mysteries may likewise make ready your way, by turning the hearts of the disobedient to the ways of the righteous, that at your second coming to judge the world we may be found an acceptable people in your sight; for you live and reign with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever. Amen.

| **From the Passage** | Gracious and holy Father,<br><br> We come before You this Christmas in a world filled with darkness—  violence, fear, grief, and sin that we cannot fix or escape.<br><br> We thank You for Your Servant, the One You chose, upheld, and exalted—  the One who bore our griefs and carried our sorrows,  who was pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities.<br><br> We all, like sheep, have gone astray.  We have wandered in pride, fear, and self-righteousness into idolatry and sin.<br><br> Yet You laid our sin on Your Servant,  and through His wounds we are healed.<br><br> Thank You that in Him justice is satisfied  and mercy is poured out—  that the guilty are forgiven  and the broken are restored.<br><br> Lift our eyes to see the splendour of Your Servant.  Clear our guilt, quiet our fear, and assure us of our peace with You.<br><br> Shape us to be servant-hearted people, willing to step into the darkness,  to stand in the breach,  and to bear witness to the grace we have receive that others winners may experience your grace in Jesus..<br><br> We pray in the name of Jesus Christ,  the Servant who was despised,  now exalted,  and worshipped by all nations. Amen. <br><br> **Amen**.|
