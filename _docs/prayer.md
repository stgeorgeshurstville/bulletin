**Prayer**

Lord God, you know us to be set in the midst of so many great dangers that by reason of the frailty of our nature we cannot always stand upright: grant us such strength and protection as may support us in all dangers and carry us through all temptations; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

- Gracious God, we pray for high school scripture classes and chaplaincy programs. Bless the teachers and chaplains with wisdom and courage. May they inspire young hearts to know and follow Jesus. Protect and guide their work for Your glory. Amen.

- General info: There are >800 languages spoken in Papua New Guinea, but only 13 have complete bibles. Calvin and Ruth work alongside Papua New Guineans in roles that support the ongoing ministry of bible translation.

Ruth provides training for the bible translators, so that locals can take the lead in this work.
