## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** Almighty God, the protector of all who put their trust in you, without whom nothing is strong, nothing is holy: increase and multiply upon us your mercy, so that with you as our ruler and guide, we may so pass through things temporal that we finally lose not the things eternal; grant this, heavenly Father, for our Lord Jesus Christ’s sake. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Loving and compassionate Father, You are full of grace and kindness, patient and overflowing with love and faithfulness. Your holiness and fairness shine brightly, yet you never turn away from those who seek you. We find our safety and comfort in you, our God. Our lives are entrusted to your care, and we trust in your unfailing love. O faithful God, as we come before your throne of grace through Jesus, we humbly ask for your mercy and grace to meet our every need. May your Spirit work within us, producing in us the beautiful fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In the precious name of your beloved Son, we pray. Amen.
- **Saviour:** God of all grace, You have given me a Savior. Grant me the faith to rely on Him completely, making Him my desire, hope, and glory. May I find refuge in Him, build my life upon His teachings, and walk in His ways. Let me follow His example, heed His guidance, and trust in His intercession. May I never be ashamed of Him, but proudly bear His name and teachings. Keep me from being swayed by the world's allurements or frightened by its threats. Help me to remember that this world is not my home, but that I am a pilgrim seeking a heavenly country. May I grow daily in readiness for that eternal home, and may all I do be done in the name of the Savior. Amen.
- **Growing Out:** Our gracious Father, thank you that the Gospel is the power of salvation to all people. Thank you that even now the just has the Gospel has come to us, it is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world. We pray that many in our generation will hear and truly understand you grace. Please help us to be godly in life, resilient in ministry, servant-hearted, Biblical in life, thought and ministry, and able to love and minister faithfully, compassionately and effectively in different and changing contexts, cooperating with one another, humble, wise, prayerful, reflective, energetic and effective. Please help us to take our faith in Jesus beyond the walls of the church into our workplace, school, where we live and where we holiday. Please help us to have a compassion for the lost like Jesus. Please help us to be willing to go into the world, to be interested in the lives of people we meet. Please give us opportunities to represent Jesus and to speak of Him. Please give us the words to say. Please save our neighbours through us.
- **Sermon:**  Lord and merciful Father, the nations have conspired and the people have plotted in vain. The kings of the earth have risen against you and against your anointed. But you have humbled them by installing your king on your holy mountain. You have overcome evil, death and sin through the Death and Resurrection of your Beloved. Thank you for forgiving the sins of your people and purifying them, making us holy in your sight. Whilst we continue to live in exile in Babylon, help us to long for Home. By our words and lives, help us to proclaim the message of the Gospel to those who are in Babylon. We pray this in the name of the Great Shepherd of the Sheep, Amen.

## Mission Partner Focus

- **Local High School Scripture with Semi**: Loving Father, we thank you that you want all people of all ages to come to a saving knowledge of you. We ask that the high schoolers in our area (especially at Hurstville Boys, Sydney Tech and Oatley High) will see Jesus as the way, the truth and the life. May you help students to find their identity, security and comfort in Jesus particularly when things get busy, life doesn’t work out as planned, physical and mental illness, relational conflict and the future may seem confusing and meaningless. We praise you for providing Semi Kolikata to share his life and doctrine to the students and for the smooth start he has had. Please help him to make good connections with the school and students and enable him to share the good news. May he family adjust well to his new role. 
- **Papua New Guinea and Mathys**: Father God, we realise that all flesh is like grass yet your word remains forever. We ask that you will use the Mathys and other bible translators to transform PNG for Jesus with your precious and powerful word. Give them patience, good team work and insight. We pray that Petra, Andi and Jakob will keep growing in Christ and being missional as they navigate the different stages of life. May the 17 million people in PNG come to know Christ as their Lord and Saviour. Please help them to trust in Jesus rather than in political alliances and powers. Please help the locals to cope with the rising cost of living, future uncertainties and natural disasters.

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Hurstville**: We pray that the 30,000 people in Hurstville, with many from different cultures and countries, will come to know Jesus as their Lord and Saviour. May we have a heart for the people you have placed around us. May we be lights in our neighbourhood which is in darkness and filled with anxiety and uncertainty. May we be mindful of the changing demographics and seek to share the gospel with them. We commit to you the Nepali community and ask that many will come to know Christ through the ministry of Bijaya and our church. May Chris Minns (NSW Premier and Legislative Assembly Member for Kogarah), Linda Burney (House Representative for Barton), David Coleman (House Representative for Banks) and Nick Katris (Mayor) know God as the one with ultimate authority and serve and lead with love, justice and wisdom. 
- **Discipleship Groups**: We praise you for the opportunity to spur each other to love and good deeds. May the seed of God’s word grow as we plant and water. May we know who Jesus is as we grow in our secure attachment with him. Help us to be vulnerable, repentant and Christ like as we inwardly digest, delight in and do his word. 
- **Pastoral Care Team**: Father, you sent your Son to heal the brokenhearted. May we cast our burdens and anxieties upon you knowing that you can sympathise with our weaknesses and care for us. May the peace of God sustain us as we bear the hope of the gospel, point people to heaven and carry each other’s burdens. 
- **People with Disabilities**: Thank you that all people are made in your image. We pray for those with disabilities that they would know their true value as your image-bearers. May your love in Jesus heal them from any experience of rejection and pain. We pray that they will know of Jesus’ sufficiency in their experience of chronic pain and suffering. Forgive us for the ways we have often treated people with disabilities. Please help us to be like Jesus in welcoming all people and going out to love, seek and save the lost. Please open our eyes to see them as whole human beings and the seemingly weaker parts of the body are indispensable. Please help us to learn and listen from those with disabilities and their carers. May the world see Jesus through our love for one another. We look forward to the day when Jesus returns and his people will be given sinless resurrection bodies. Amen.
- **Support Ministries**: Everlasting God, we give thanks for the many volunteers who have been faithfully serving in different ministries at church both up front and behind the scenes. Please strengthen and sustain them with patience, understanding and joy to love and care. May you use their gifts and talents to build up the church which is the body of Christ. We ask this for the communication, cleaning, flower, bulletin, meals, AV, sound, music, bible readin, maintenance, prayer, set up, pack up, welcoming, technology and other teams. May people come to know Jesus as the Son of Man who came to serve and not to be served through our words and actions. May we all see that we have been given the manifestation of the Spirit to build up one another.
