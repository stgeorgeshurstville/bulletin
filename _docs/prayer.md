## Collect
Almighty God, give us grace that we may cast away the works of darkness and put on the armour of light, now in the time of this mortal life in which your Son Jesus Christ came among us in great humility; that on the last day, when he comes again in his glorious majesty to judge the living and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through him who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever. Amen.

| **From the Passage** | **Almighty and faithful God,** <br>You are the Creator of all, the One who directs the course of history, and the only One worthy of our trust.<br><br>The human race has suppressed the truth by our wickedness. We have neither glorified You as God nor given thanks to You. Our thinking has become futile, and our foolish hearts darkened. We think we are wise, but in truth we are fools, exchanging Your glory for idols.<br><br>You have summoned the world to answer for its folly. You have sent Your Servant, Jesus, to bring justice, light, and freedom. Thank You for declaring Him Lord by raising Him from the dead. You are justified in giving us over to the foolish desires of our hearts, and yet You are merciful and compassionate.<br><br>Thank You, our Lord, for being gentle yet strong, faithful to the end, and empowered by Your Spirit to make all things right. Through Him, the blind see, the captives are freed, and hope is restored. Thank You that He is Your Word and our covenant, the light of the nations.<br><br>We look once again to Him. May we honour Him as Your beloved and delight. May we proclaim His glory, that the world will come to honour Him.<br>**Amen**.|
