## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer**: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.

- **Collect**: Lord God, you know us to be set in the midst of so many great dangers that by reason of the frailty of our nature we cannot always stand upright: grant us such strength and protection as may support us in all dangers and carry us through all temptations; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

- **Mission**: Our gracious Father, thank you for the privilege of calling us to join in your mission. Thank you that under you what we do makes a difference in the world. We pray therefore that you will save those around us and to transform them into the likeness of Jesus. Please use us to make disciples of the nations, love our neighbours. Please Father, glorify yourself, through our labour in your Son. We pray that we will not be consumers but contributors to the ministries that you have called us to. 

- **Church Sermon**: Almighty and everlasting God, you are always more ready to hear than we to pray and to give more than either we desire or deserve: pour down upon us the abundance of your mercy, forgiving us those things of which our conscience is afraid and giving us those good things which we are not worthy to ask but through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.

## Mission Related Prayer Points
- **World:** May you lead the nations of the world in the ways of righteousness and peace. Please guide our rulers in wisdom and justice. May there be peace and tranquillity so that we can live godly and holy lives and that people can come to the knowledge of the truth. May we submit to those you’ve placed in authority and ultimately to your reign and rule. May people live and long for the new world to come rather than seek to gain the world and forfeit our souls. 

- **Persecuted Christians:** We thank you for sending Jesus who is sovereign and came to save the world by sacrificing himself. Please give patience and perseverance to those who are being persecuted for the faith. We think of your people in North Korea, Somalia, Libya, Eritrea and Yemen. May they be a model and example of what it means to have a calling in life and a confidence for the future. You can sign up for more prayer points and updates of persecuted Christians from Open Doors [here](https://vom.com.au/pray-for-the-persecuted-church/) and Voice of the Martyrs [here](https://vom.com.au/prayer/).

- **Compassion:** Jesus came to seek and to save the lost. You tell us that true religion is to visit orphans and widows in their affliction. May Compassion Australia seek to release children from poverty in Jesus’ name. May we do what we can to love children and their families so that they will mature physically, mentally, socially and most importantly spiritually. May we prayerfully invest in the lives of the children in Sumba Indonesia and see a whole region won and living for God. May you give wisdom to our 11 partner churches in the area to love and care for the children. May these children have enough sustenance, health and support as they participate in the program and activities. For us who sponsor a child through Compassion, may we keep praying, communicating and supporting them and their family.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Redevelopment:** Our Gracious God and Heavenly Father, You know our needs. You have richly provided and we know that you will continue to provide what we need for the mission that you have called us to. May our faithful stewardship bear witness to the love of Jesus Christ in our lives. We pray this in the name of the one who is building us into a spiritual house for a holy priesthood and to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to you.

- **Sunday Services:** Thank you heavenly Father for our ascended King. Thank you for the gifts of apostles, evangelists, pastors, teachers, service leaders, musicians and all those who serve us. We pray that you will use their service for the building up of the church, that we may reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of your Son and become mature. We ask this for Bible readers, service leaders, musicians, welcomers and other volunteers.

- **Staff and Parish Council:** We praise you for the leaders you’ve appointed over us. May they love and care for the church of God which you obtained with your own blood. May they prayerfully set forth the life giving word through their lives and teaching. Clothe them with holiness, zeal and servant heartedness. We pray for our wardens and parish councillors, may they have wisdom, insight and passion to see our church family be spiritually transformed for your glory. Please use them to help us stay focused and accountable with the resources you’ve given us.

- **English Congregation:** May we have a secure attachment to Jesus in 2024. May God use our programs and plans to see us deepen our trust, have a personal relationship with God and have a faith that is public. 

- **Families:** We remember the families of our church community. We pray that despite the busyness, you will be an ever presence and comfort to them. Please help kids and their families to set the right priorities, the discipline to say ‘no’. May our love for and devotion to you be our greatest desire. We bow our knees before you the Father from whom every family is named. Help parents and spiritual uncles and aunties to impart the knowledge of you and of your love; and children to respond with love and obedience. We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
