## Week 4 (Fourth Sunday of the month)

| From the Passage | Heavenly Father, We bow before You, the God from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name. We thank You for Your mercy—so rich, so undeserved—that You have poured out on us through Jesus Christ. You have not treated us as we deserve. You have not measured us by our usefulness or success, but by the infinite worth of Your Son who gave Himself for us. And in Him, You have declared us loved, forgiven, and chosen. Strengthen us now, we pray, with power through Your Spirit in our inner being, so that Christ may dwell in our hearts through faith. Root us and ground us in love—not the self-seeking love of this world, but the self-giving love of Christ who gave all of Himself as a living sacrifice. Help us see with new eyes what true worship is: Not just a song we sing, or a service we attend, but a whole life laid down, joyfully and freely, in view of Your mercy. Forgive us, Lord, when we’ve thought of ministry as a burden, a payment, or a way to prove ourselves. Remind us again that we serve not to earn Your love, but because we are already so deeply loved. Help us see that in Your kingdom, even the weakest member is of immeasurable value. Renew our minds, reshape our hearts, and conform our lives to the pattern of Christ. And may we, together as Your church, grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ. May we know and testify this love that surpasses knowledge, that we may be filled to the measure of all Your fullness.In Jesus' name we pray, Amen. |
| Mission & Vision | **For Growing Up**<br>Father, help us grow deeper in our relationship with You. Give us a hunger for Your Word, a heart of prayer, and a life of obedience. May our faith mature as we walk closely with Jesus each day. Amen | 
| Global & Nation | **Nation**<br>Lord of all nations, we thank You for Australia. Bless our leaders with wisdom, guide our people in justice and peace, and help us to be a nation that welcomes the vulnerable and seeks the common good. Amen |
| Mission Partners  | **Hoi-Yan Shea in Japane**<br>General info: Hoi-Yan is involved in church-planting work in Japan with OMF. Pray for Hoi-Yan amidst recent discouragements and disappointments in her mission work; as relationships that she has carefully nurtured have been disrupted by change in circumstances (e.g. they stop meeting because they move to another city, or family opposition, or a sin issue). Pray that her eyes may be opened to see God’s power at work in her life, and that she may run with perseverance and not grow weary. Pray for wisdom and guidance in knowing how to love and share the truth with the people that she comes in contact with daily (e.g. neighbours, cafe owners, staff at the afterschool care centre). Praise God for the work of the Holy Spirit in the lives of the people in her bible study group. Pray that they can continue to witness Jesus to their family and work colleagues. Praise God for the Disciple Making Lab, a training event that their team had the opportunity to attend. Pray for the Spirit’s guidance in applying what they have learnt to their context. |
| Church Ministries | **Chilren and SRE**:<br>
**Children**
Praise God for the opportunity to focus on gospel truths with the kids this term. Pray for good faith conversations as the kids think about their own faith. Pray for the leaders and their parents to always be ready to point them to Jesus. 
**SRE**
Pray especially for our SRE teachers and helpers as the season get colder that God would protect the health of our team and that kids would continue to hear the good news of Jesus without their lessons being interrupted by sickness or cancellations. |
| Groups In Church| **Familes**<br>Lord, we thank you for creating the family that we belong to. We pray that as a church family we may be able to continue to spur each other on until Jesus return. Amen.|
| Special Items & Events | **The floods in NSW**
Prayer in a Time of Flood All things look to you, O Lord, to give them their food in due season; look in mercy on your people, and hear our prayer for those whose lives and livelihood are threatened by flood. In your mercy, save both man and beast. We pray for all who serve in our emergency services: SES, fire and rescue, police, ambulance, members of our defence force, and other responders. Give them courage and comfort in all dangers. And help us, we pray, to work together, in peace and safety, for the common good. We ask all this through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. |
