## Collect
Lord God, you know us to be set in the midst of so many great dangers that by reason of the frailty of our nature we cannot always stand upright: grant us such strength and protection as may support us in all dangers and carry us through all temptations; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

| **From the Passage** | **Almighty Father, the only true God,** We thank You that eternal life is not a distant prize, but the gift of knowing You. We praise You for sending Your Son, Jesus Christ, to bring us out of the darkness and into Your light.<br><br>**Lord Jesus, our Brother and Saviour,** Forgive us for treating Your grace like an exam to be passed. Stop us from merely staring at the dust of our own performance. Help us to look along the light of Your Word until we see the Father’s face, and know ourselves to be Your beloved brothers and sisters.<br><br>**Holy Spirit, our Comforter and Guide,** Teach us to participate in the life of the Trinity. When we pray, when we study, and when we serve, remind us that we are not alone, but are joined to the eternal conversation of Father, Son, and Spirit.<br><br>**God of all nations,** Whether we are Anglo, Chinese, or Nepali, unite us as one family. This year, help us to truly know You, and in the joy of our adoption, to make You known to our neighbors.<br><br>**To the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, be all glory, now and forever. Amen.**|
