**From the Passage**
<br><br> Gracious God,
 You are our refuge and strength,
 yet we confess that we often seek safety elsewhere.
 We trust in our plans, possessions, and people
 more than in You.
 We fear losing control more than losing sight of You.

Lord, have mercy.
 We admit we’re reluctant to let You expose our idols,
 because we hold them so tightly.
 But we ask — gently, patiently —
 show us what we’ve trusted instead of You,
 and free us from their grip.

Thank You that Jesus, gentle and lowly,
 does not come to crush but to save;
 not to condemn but to give rest.
 Help us to be still,
 to cease striving,
 and to know that You are God —
 our refuge, our salvation, our peace.

Through Christ our Lord,

Amen.

**Mission Partners**
<br><br>*Compassion*   
General info: Compassion is a Christian international holistic child development organisation. In response to God’s call, Compassion gives hope to the hopeless, spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ in a culturally relevant, non-coercive way. Through our Child Sponsorship Program, more than 2 million children are currently being released from poverty in Jesus’ name.

This Sunday we are praying for three projects that Compassion supports throughout many towns and villages all over the world. 

*1. The Global Food Crisis Support*
We pray first for immediate provision. We ask you to supply emergency food, water, and life-saving aid to children and families suffering from the severe Global Food Crisis. Sustain the most vulnerable and give the local church partners the resources and wisdom to deliver help where it is most desperate.

*2. Mums and Babies Survival Projects*
We pray for a strong foundation of life. Watch over every vulnerable mother and infant in the Mums and Babies Survival Projects. Grant health, safe deliveries, and a strong start to life. May the church staff minister life, hope, and community to these families.

*3. The Whole Child Approach*
Finally, we pray for the holistic development of The Whole Child. We ask that you meet their physical needs (health and safety), their educational needs (a hopeful future), their social needs (protection and belonging), and most importantly, their spiritual needs, so they may be released from poverty in Jesus' name, realizing their full, God-given potential.

**Church Ministries**
<br><br> *English Congregation - A prayer to keep on shining!*  

Heavenly Father, we thank you for the vision you've given our church this year: to shine for Jesus, anyplace anytime. As this year draws to a close, we ask that you firmly implant this mission in our hearts.

We confess that it is easy to shine in here, within the walls of this church, but often hard to live that light out there, in the world. Forgive us for the moments we have hidden our light under a basket—when fear of rejection, the pull of comfort, or simple busyness kept us silent.

Lord, ignite in us a conviction to realize that "anyplace" means our workplaces, our schools, our homes, and the grocery aisle. Show us that "anytime" means in traffic, during a difficult conversation, or when we are tired and depleted.

May we end this year not by slowing down, but by running the final miles with greater fervour, leaving a trail of your light and love wherever our feet may take us.

We pray this in the powerful name of Jesus, the Light of the World.

Amen.
