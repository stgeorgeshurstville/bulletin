**Week 1**

We pray therefore that you will save those around us and to transform them into the likeness of Jesus. Please use us to make disciples of the nations, love our neighbours. Please Father, glorify yourself, through our labour in your Son. We pray that we will not be consumers but contributors to the ministries that you have called us to.

You are holy and fair, but you never turn away from those who look for you. We feel safe and comforted with you, our God. We trust you with our lives and know your love never fails. As we come to you through Jesus, we ask for your mercy and help with everything we need. Let your Spirit work in us to grow love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.

Growing Up: Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day.

Pray that our kids would grow more and more like Jesus each day.

Pray that our young people would keep wrestling and engaging with their faith in Jesus.

- Mandarin congregations  - Gracious Father, we thank You that two of our Mandarin D-groups will be trained in evangelism this term. We pray that members would not only be encouraged to share Jesus but also continue to be convicted by the truth of the gospel. We thank You for the enthusiasm of our newly formed Outreach & Marketing committee, and we pray that through their work, more non-Christians from our community will come to our church and know Jesus.
- JC in SE Asia - You call your global church to make and mature disciples of all nations, peoples, tribes and tongues. We ask that you’ll allow our brother JC to lovingly, wisely and yet boldly share the victory of Christ in his secure location. Though we don't even know his full name to protect his identity, you Sovereign Lord know all, you know his name, his location, his heart and his steps. We ask you to protect him in a country where evangelism is not allowed and publicly practising one’s faith is difficult. Thank you for the opportunity you provided for JC to share your gospel as an IELTS teacher, please soften the hearts of the people he comes across. May you raise up leaders in the university and also in his local church, especially as numbers grow. We also pray for the local governing authorities to accept King Jesus, ruler of the renewed Kingdom.  May you also save JC’s immediate and extended family here in Australia, for them to see the risk and danger he and many others are willing to face for your kingdom.
