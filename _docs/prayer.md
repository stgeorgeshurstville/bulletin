## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** Almighty and everlasting God, you are always more ready to hear than we to pray, and constantly give more than either we desire or deserve: pour down on us the abundance of your mercy, forgiving us those things of which our conscience is afraid, and giving us those good things which we are not worthy to ask, except through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ, your Son our Lord. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Dear God, our loving and kind Father, you are full of grace and patience, and you always love us. You are holy and fair, but you never turn away from those who look for you. We feel safe and comforted with you, our God. We trust you with our lives and know your love never fails. As we come to you through Jesus, we ask for your mercy and help with everything we need. Let your Spirit work in us to grow love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
- **Enjoy God:** Almighty and Merciful God, You are attentive to prayers. Your presence draws me in, for you never turn away those who seek you. In my trials and needs, I seek refuge in you. Fill me with your Spirit of grace, guiding my thoughts and attitudes towards prayerful communion with you. May my daily life be infused with thoughts of you, finding solace and guidance. I am grateful for the capacity to know, resemble, and enjoy you. You are the source of all existence, excellence, and happiness. Guide me throughout my journey, providing counsel, defense and comfort. May my faith be evident in my conscience and visible to those around me. As Jesus intercedes for me in heaven, may I reflect his love and grace on earth. May your gentle goodness continue to accompany me, whether awake or asleep. May your blessings be ever present. Your promises have proven true, lifting me from sorrow, fear and despair. I am continually reminded of your faithfulness, and for this, I offer my praises. Amen.
- **Sermon:** Gracious Heavenly Father, Jesus alone is worthy, He is worthy to be loved with all of our heart and all of our strength. We ask, Father, that you’ll help us to labour for Jesus’ dear and beloved church to mature. To mature in how much we depend on Him, to depend on Him to bear our debt of sin before you, to depend on Him to reconcile us to you. Help us to also mature in our godliness, shape us in every way so that we’d be like our Lord, that the people around us can see our actions, deeds, thoughts and smell the aroma of Christ. Help us Father, to work hard for the church, so that many more would be saved, forever secured in Him. We pray Father, that you’d show Christ to Hurstville and beyond, and please, lead and guide St Georges and the other churches nearby,  and use our labours to accomplish that end.

## Mission Related Prayer Points
- **JC in SE Asia:** You call us to make and mature disciples of all nations. We ask that you’ll allow JC to courageously, lovingly and prayerfully share the gospel in a country where evangelism is not allowed and even publicly practicing one’s faith is difficult. We are thankful that gatherings can now be in person after closures in April and May. May you soften the hearts of the authorities and the people so that they’ll hear and accept the peace, purpose and real spiritual prosperity in Jesus. May you raise up Christians and leaders in the university and church especially as numbers grow. May you save JC’s immediate and extended family. May you give opportunities for JC to be empathetic and share the good news in his role as an IELTS teacher.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Government:** You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May they enact laws and initiatives so that the orphans, widows and harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. May they come to a saving knowledge of the truth. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit and keep doing what is holy, pure, righteous, good and loving. 
- **Children:** Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow their hearts to love Jesus and become more like Him each day. Give strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to genuinely love the kids and show them Jesus. 
- **Youth:** Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength and security in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness. May we be a safe and respectful environment where youths can explore life’s questions, build strong friendships and find true meaning. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities and pressures. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness. Help them to understand what life and leadership in Jesus looks like especially as we look at the books of Romans and Titus. May we be a church family who model Christlikeness and keep praying and supporting all generations including youths.
- **SRE:** Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus in our local public school. May we never take this for granted. Give our combined Christian teacher team (Lam, Carol, George, Fiona, Alice, Tracey, Glorya, Fiona, and Felishia) strength to keep teaching and witnessing faithfully. 
- **Mandarin Congregation:** Gracious Father, we thank you for the ongoing openness of Mainland Chinese to the gospel and many have just turned up on a Sunday. We pray that we can be more effective in our advertising in drawing them to come and hear God's word. We praise you that the gospel is reaching younger generations as there are now 12 young families at our 4pm Mandarin congregation; we pray that the gospel can continue to grow through them to future generations.
