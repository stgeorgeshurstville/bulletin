## Sunday Prayer Pointss

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect**: Grant us, Lord, we pray, the spirit to think and do always such things as are right, that we who cannot do anything that is good without you, may in your strength be able to live according to your will; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Mission**: Our gracious Father, thank you for the privilege of calling us to join in your mission. Thank you that under you what we do makes a difference in the world. We pray therefore that you will save those around us and to transform them into the likeness of Jesus. Please use us to make disciples of the nations, love our neighbours. Please Father, glorify yourself, through our labour in your Son. We pray that we will not be consumers but contributors to the ministries that you have called us to.
- **Church Sermon:** Our Glorious God and Heavenly Father, We have often been foolish. We have been seduced by the world’s power, intimated by its wisdom. We have built our lives around, pinned our hopes on and pray for our children to gain power and wisdom. Yet you have graciously shown us in your Son and by your Spirit that they are unworthy of our trust. Help us to keep trusting in your power through Jesus and him crucified. Help us to be embolden by  the Cross Jesus and to confidently and simply and faithfully commend it to others. Help us to continue to grow in conformity to Jesus and him crucified. Amen.

## Mission Partners
- **Persecuted Christians:** We thank you for sending Jesus who is sovereign and came to save the world by sacrificing himself. Please give patience and perseverance to those who are being persecuted for the faith. May they be a model and example of what it means to have a calling in life and a confidence for the future. May they seek to do the will of you rather than themselves. May there be justice. If this isn’t achieved, may they keep looking to you as the judge and respond with love rather than revenge. You can sign up for more prayer points and updates of persecuted Christians from Open Doors (https://vom.com.au/pray-for-the-persecuted-church/) and Voice of the Martyrs (https://vom.com.au/prayer/).
- **Compassion:** Jesus came to seek and to save the lost. You tell us that true religion is to visit orphans and widows in their affliction. May Compassion Australia seek to release children from poverty in Jesus’ name. May we do what we can to love children and their families so that they will mature physically, mentally, socially and most importantly spiritually. May we prayerfully invest in the lives of the children in Sumba Indonesia and see a whole region won and living for God. May you give wisdom to our 11 partner churches in the area to love and care for the children. May these children have enough sustenance, health and support as they participate in the program and activities. For those who personally sponsor a child, may we keep praying, communicating and supporting them and their family.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **World**: We pray that you will lead the nations of the world in the ways of righteousness and peace. Please guide our rulers in wisdom and justice. May there be tranquillity so that we can live godly and holy lives and people can come to the knowledge of the truth. May we submit to those you’ve placed in authority and ultimately to your reign and rule. May people live and long for the new world to come rather than seek to gain the world and forfeit our souls. 
  
- **Redevelopment**: Things are progressing in what they we’re not expecting. AGed care may not longer be feasible. But other uses may be. Please pray that we can find the best way to do this. Please also pray for the archeological studies that will be need to be done to prepare for the development. 
  
- **Sunday Services**: Please thank God for the many volunteers who make Sunday meetings possible. Please pray for the new 4pm service, and for those who are affected by changes. Please pray that all that we do on Saturday and Sunday will help everyone to know Jesus. Please also pray that we will not give up meeting together (in person).   
  
- **Staff and Parish Council**: Please pray for the changes in staff. Please also pray for the parish council meeting this week. There are challenges and opportunities.

- **English Congregations**: May we have Jesus as the centre of our lives in 2023. May God use our programs and plans to see us deepen our trust, have a personal relationship with God and have a faith that is public.

- **Families**: We remember the families of our church community. We pray that despite the busyness, you will be an ever presence and comfort to them. Please help kids and their families to set the right priorities, the discipline to say ‘no’. May our love for and devotion to you be our greatest desire. We bow our knees before you the Father from whom every family is named. Help parents and spiritual uncles and aunties to impart the knowledge of you and of your love; and children to respond with love and obedience. We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
