## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.

- **Collect:** Merciful Lord, grant to your faithful people pardon and peace, that they may be cleansed from all their sins, and serve you with a quiet mind; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

- **Mission**: Our gracious Father, thank you for the privilege of calling us to join in your mission. Thank you that under you what we do makes a difference in the world. We pray therefore that you will save those around us and to transform them into the likeness of Jesus. Please use us to make disciples of the nations, love our neighbours. Please Father, glorify yourself, through our labour in your Son. We pray that we will not be consumers but contributors to the ministries that you have called us to.
- **Church Sermon**: Almighty and everlasting God, you are always more ready to hear than we to pray and to give more than either we desire or deserve. Please help us to pursue love always, in all things and for all people. Please help us to see what is needed in the building up of the church. We pray that you will give us the gifts that are necessary to do this, especially the gift of prophecy. Please give us the wisdom and discernment so that we know when it is appropriate to use or not use these gifts. We pray this in the name of our ascended and victorious king, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.


## Weekly Prayer Points
- **Conflict in the middle east**: God of the nations, whose kingdom rules over all, have mercy on our broken and divided world. In the land of our Saviour’s birth, banish the spirit that makes for war. Please give wisdom to those you have placed in authority, rescue the captives, shield those in danger, and bind up the broken hearted. For those fighting for justice, may they be strengthened by your grace. For those walking in darkness, may the light of your face shine upon them. Above all, we pray that the people of Israel and the Middle East will find everlasting hope in you. And in the land of your Son’s redeeming death and resurrection, turn hearts to look to the Saviour and live. Bring peace, Lord, while we wait for Christ's coming and rule, when all people will beat their swords into plowshares, when nation will not take up sword against nation, and when every tear will be wiped away by the Prince of Peace and Lord of Lords, Amen

- **St Andrew’s Cathedral School**: God of all mercy, giver of all comfort: when we cannot understand the things that happen, and are weighed down by loss and loneliness, uphold us in your love. Look graciously, we pray, on those in grief, pain, and confusion, especially the victim's family, whose loss is so keen, together with the whole St Andrew’s Cathedral and Danebank Anglican School community: for students, teachers, other staff, alumni, and also their families. We pray specifically for Head of Schools, Dr Julie McGonigle and Dr Emma Burgess, for her Executive team and for the school Chaplains, called to lead the School community through this time of trouble: grant them depths of wisdom, compassion and resilience. We pray also for students with final HSC and IB exams coping with this additional stress. Casting all their cares on you, may each member of the School community know the consolation of your love. Give us all the assurance of your constant care, that we may have courage for the days ahead. We pray in the name of our Friend and Saviour, the only one to promise to wipe every tear from our eyes, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen

- **HSC Exams (11 Oct-3 Nov)** May they (and their families) have strength, wisdom, calmness, purpose and the peace of God. May they be able to do their best and be comforted in knowing that their identity is in Christ. 

- **Indigenous Australians:** Holy Father, God of Love, You are the Creator of this land and of all good things. Our hope is in you because you gave your Son Jesus to reconcile the world to you. We pray for your strength and grace to forgive, accept and love one another, as you love us and forgive and accept us in the sacrifice of your Son. Give us the courage to accept the realities of our history so that we may build a better future for our nation. Teach us to respect all cultures. Teach us to care for our land and waters. Help us to share justly the resources of this land. Help us to bring about spiritual and social change to improve the quality of life for all groups in our communities, especially the disadvantaged. Help young people to find true dignity and self esteem by your Spirit. May your power and love be the foundations on which we build our families, our communities and our nation, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
  
- **Reformation Day**: Father, we can’t take credit for the faith which enabled me to receive gospel-righteousness. This too is a gift from you, Lord Jesus! So on this Reformation Day, I once again affirm that my hope is built on nothing less, nothing more, and nothing other than Jesus’ blood and your righteousness. All other ground is sinking sand. Keep bringing me back to the gospel; keep bringing me back to the gospel plus nothing, as my everything.
