| From the Passage | Gracious and loving God,

Thank you that you are not a distant force or cold power, but a living God who speaks and gives and loves. Thank you for revealing yourself not only in wisdom and strength, but in weakness and suffering, in Jesus— your Son who served us by giving his life for us. We praise you for your Spirit, by whom we are able to say, “Jesus is Lord,” and without whom we could not come to you.

For those of us who trust in Christ, we thank you for drawing us to yourself—not because of our effort or worth, but purely by your grace.
Yet we confess:  Too often, we have made your gifts all about us. We compare and compete. We hoard what we have and withhold help. In our pride, we’ve refused to ask for help or admit our need of others. We’ve mistaken gifts for godliness, and ministry for self-worth.  Father, forgive us.

Thank you for the diversity of gifts you give by your Spirit.  Thank you that we are not all the same, and that through our differences you create a community that can only exist by your grace. Help us to use what we’ve been given in love—for the good of others. Teach us not only to serve, but also to receive—to let others love us with the gifts you’ve given them.  Keep us pointing not to ourselves, but to your grace, to your Son, and to your steadfast love.

And for those here who are still searching, unsure or new to all this—may they see something of you today:  Not just in words, but in lives shaped by grace. May they come to know you—not as a distant God of logic or force, but the God who draws near in love.

In Jesus’ name we pray, Amen.|

| Global & Nation | **Government**<br>Lord of all governments, we thank You for the governance of Australia. Bless our leaders with wisdom, guide our people in justice and peace, and help us to be a nation that serves you accordingly. Amen |
| Mission Partners  | **Mathys and PNG**<br>General info: There are >800 languages spoken in Papua New Guinea, but only 13 have complete bibles. Calvin and Ruth work alongside Papua New Guineans in roles that support the ongoing ministry of bible translation. Calvin is an aircraft maintenance engineer, in order to provide transport and logistics support for bible translators. Ruth provides training for the bible translators, so that locals can take the lead in this work. [Summary of March 2025 newsletter, however await their live updates on the day!] Currently on home assignment in Melbourne. Give thanks for being able to enjoy a family holiday. Pray for them as they present and speak at churches. Pray for God to continue providing financial partnerships as they determine a new field budget and aim to return to PNG in July. Pray that they can trust God to be content and be good stewards of his generous provision. Pray for their children (Jakob as he settles into new student accommodation, and for Andreas/Petra as they continue schooling online) |
| Church Ministries | **A prayer for the church plant into HPS:**:<br>  Heavenly Father, We come before You with hearts full of gratitude, thanking You for hearing our prayers and opening the door for us to serve our neighbours through Hurstville Public School. You are the God who makes a way where there seems to be none, and we praise You for this opportunity to share Your love and truth with the school community. Lord, we lift up this new ministry to You. We ask for Your guidance in every logistical and practical detail—smooth transitions, clear communication, willing volunteers, and the resources we need to serve faithfully. Calm the fears of those who are anxious, and fill us all with Your peace that surpasses understanding. Above all, Father, align our hearts with Your will. We know Your heart beats for the salvation of sinners—for the lost to be sought and found. May Your name be hallowed in our words, our lives, our thoughts, and our relationships. Let Your kingdom come in our midst as we reflect the glory of Jesus, shining as a light to the school community and beyond. Grant us wisdom to love well, courage to speak truth with grace, and humility to depend on You in all things. May everything we do point others to Christ, the hope of the world. In Jesus’ name, Amen. |
