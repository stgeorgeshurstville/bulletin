<ins>Moore College:</ins>
Pray for God to be at work through His Spirit as students and faculty are involved in outreach and training events over the summer break. Pray that beach missions, camps, and conferences will be attended well and that many people would hear the gospel.

<ins>Projects (Anglican aid & Anglicare):<ins>
Anglicare prayer: God grant us the compassion to care deeply for others, the wisdom to discern how best to help, the energy to transform emotion into action, and the joy of wholehearted, loving service. For Christ’s sake. Amen
For December: Please pray for the success of the Christmas appeal. For those whom Anglicare serves will experience the joy and hope during this holiday season and praise God for the volunteers and donors who run pantry appeals, providing food to Anglicare’s emergency relief centers and bringing hope and joy to those in need this Christmas. 

For Anglican Aid: Heavenly Father, whose will it is that all people will be saved, and come to a knowledge of  the truth, and whose will it is that we care for the poor, needy, widows, orphans and refugees. We pray for the work of the Archbishop of Sydney’s Anglican Aid.  We pray for your grace to fulfil every good work that you have prepared for us in advance to do as we anticipate the triumphant return of our King and Saviour, in whose name we pray. Amen.

Sub-Saharan Africa: Pray for Internally Displaced People (IDPs): According to the International Organisation of Migration, 32.5 million people have been internally displaced due to violence across sub-Saharan Africa. In places like Sudan, Nigeria, Mozambique, and northern Kenya, a rise in tribal clashes and Islamic extremist attacks have forced many people to flee their homes. Almighty God, you are a refuge for the oppressed; a stronghold in times of trouble. We pray for Anglican Aid’s partners in Sudan, Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, and beyond who are caring for those who have been forced to flee their homes. Please enable them to provide essential aid and spiritual care to those who need it most. God of all comfort, please bring comfort through the love of your people to those who have lost everything. For those who have been targeted due to their Christian faith, please direct their hearts into your abounding love and Christ’s perseverance. And for those who do not know you, we pray that they would find their ultimate refuge in Jesus. Lord of peace, you make wars cease to the ends of the earth. We pray that you would restore justice and peace, enabling people to return to their homes. Please bring the perpetrators of violence to repentance. And help us, and all your people, to fix our eyes on that day when Jesus will return to renew this broken world, and there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain. In his name we pray, Amen.

<ins>Passage:<ins>
Heavenly Father,thank You for sending Jesus, who taught us how to cry out to You and made You our Father through Him. In Jesus, we see that You are a God who hears, sees, cares, and saves. Thank You for welcoming us to bring our brokenness and scars from this past year to You, trusting that You are near to the brokenhearted and save those who are crushed in spirit. When we are in need, help us to cry out to You as Jesus did, confident that You hear our cries, see our pain, and act in Your perfect love to rescue and restore us. Through Jesus’ suffering and victory, we find refuge, healing, and hope. Teach us to trust in You and glorify Your name in all we do. In the name of Jesus, we pray. Amen.

  <ins>A Prayer for the Sick and Sorrowing at Christmas</ins>

  God of all comfort and Father of compassion we pray for those for whom the Christmas season is very hard.  
  We pray for those seeking refuge from family violence, at risk of homelessness, or sufferers of addictions to alcohol, substances or gambling.  
  We pray for those who will grieve the loss of loved ones who have departed this world since last Christmas, for those who are estranged from family members, for those who are ill or alone, for parents who fear they cannot provide for their children this Christmas and for children who will not see their parents.  
  May they know that you sent your Son into the world, to the lowly, the ordinary, the weary and the worried, so that we might know that you are with us; that sin and death and the devil will not win; that we are loved; and that our true home is with you.
  Thank you for all those, including our churches and Anglicare, who will partner to provide presents, food, and true and lasting hope to many this Christmas.
  We ask it in the name of him who died for sin and was raised again, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
  
  <ins>A Christmas Prayer for Peace</ins>

  Sovereign Lord, ruler and judge of the nations,
  Unto us a Son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders.
  We long for the day when every warrior’s boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be fuel for the fire.
  Have mercy we pray on this broken and divided world and bring peace – in Israel and the Palestinian territories, in Lebanon and Syria, in the Ukraine, in Sudan, Myanmar and Yemen. 
  Especially Father we pray for children caught up in conflicts not of their own making, for millions of displaced people, for women who do not know where their husbands, sons and fathers are. 
  Give wisdom, courage, urgency and diplomacy to the leaders of the nations that they may seek the welfare of their people with justice, righteousness and compassion. 
  We ask it in the name of the One of whom the greatness of his government and peace will know no end, Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
