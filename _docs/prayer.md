## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.

- **Collect:** Almighty and eternal God, grant that we may grow in faith, hope, and love; and that we may obtain what you promised, make us love what you command; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

- **Growing Up:** Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day. 

- **Church Sermon:** We praise you for allowing us to be known by you. May this reality spur us on to love you and others. May we not hold onto our rights but be willing to give them up so that we can love and build others up. Please grow our knowledge in trusting and following you. Help us to know what’s the correct thing to do. But more importantly help us to love. Amen.

## Mission Partners
- **Berkeley Life Centre:** Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain times and places so that they may find you. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast their burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. May people who are suffering from domestic violence, dealing with the police and justice system, suffering from mental illness, experiencing difficult and dysfunctional relationships and navigating health issues will know that Jesus has come for the sinners and to seek and save the lost. Please sustain Rev. Wayne Pickford and the team as they lead the church to be a light and witness in their community. We praise you for providing Samantha Trotter who will help with the womens and children ministry later in the year. We thank you for the opportunity for a number of us to visit Berkeley to meet the members, see their ministries and be involved with doorknocking and the Op Shop.

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Australia:** Guide with your wisdom and power the leaders of the nation, so that everyone may live in peace and mutual trust, sharing with justice the resources of the earth. Give the people of this land a spirit of unselfishness, compassion, and fairness in public and private life. May we might be able to live quiet and peaceful lives in order that people may come to a knowledge of the truth. We pray that you would give our leaders wisdom and a fear of you. We pray that many in our nation who are suffering may find hope, peace, comfort, life and purpose in the gospel of your Son. May Anthony Albanese and Chris Minns lead Australia and NSW well in a time of change and anxiety. May Indigenous and Torres Strait Islanders find salvation and a real voice in Jesus. 

- **Empowering Everyone with English in Jesus’ Name:** We praise you for the many people groups that are in Hurstville. May we have a heart for them to settle and live well in Australia and more importantly to find their true residence in the New Heaven. May the teachers and volunteers be a model of love and good works as they teach people about Jesus and English. We thank you for the new people who’ve come and stayed. May they find meaningful connections with others and Jesus. 

- **CanCare:** Father God, we thank you that you know what it means to face trials and pain and that you can sympathise with our weaknesses. We ask that you’ll use CanCare to support people and their family and friends who are or have suffered the ravages of cancer. Please give them wisdom in how to support this community especially during this uncertain period of COVID. May God bless those suffering from cancer with his peace. May God's salvation come to those who have yet to accept Jesus. We thank you for the events which went smoothly where the gospel was proclaimed and testimonies shared. 

- **Evangelism Teams and Programs:** Gracious Lord, our neighbours are lost and far away from you. We long for the opportunity to proclaim your name. Please give us the eyes to see those whom you have placed before us. Whenever we open our mouths, may words be given so that we will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel. May we represent Jesus and grow out. May we not give up on the lost. We pray that as the seeds of the gospel are scattered and planted, that they would land on good soil. Please make them bear fruit, Father. Scare away the crows. Crush the rocks. Strangle the weeds. Instead, give us rich healthy soil ready to receive the seeds of the gospel. In Jesus’ name, we pray. 

- **Nursing Homes and Seniors Ministries:** We thank you Father, that our hope in Jesus cannot be taken from us. We remember those who are living in residential care, those who are living at home and receiving care, those who are providing the care, and their families. We pray for safety and comfort for the aged. We pray for protection for the carers, workers and volunteers from COVID and other dangers. We pray that all will hear and experience the love and peace of Christ. 

- **Cantonese Congregations:** We pray for the follow-up training to be held on four Saturday morning that people are encouraged to guide the spiritual growth of new Christians. Lord, sometimes the evil one works so that people lose faith in Christ, we pray that our good Shepherd fed us everyday to give us strength. Lord, give us a heart to hear the needs of people, to love them because God loves us first. Give us the mission that you gather us in Hurstville not because of convenience but that your kingdom could bring blessings to a lot of people.
