## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Collect**: Keep your Church, Lord God, with your continual mercy, and because the frailty of man without you cannot but fall, keep us always under your protection, and lead us to everything that makes for our salvation; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Vision 2024** - Secure Attachment to Jesus: Dear God, our loving and kind Father, you are full of grace and patience, and you always love us. You are holy and fair, but you never turn away from those who look for you. We feel safe and comforted with you, our God. We trust you with our lives and know your love never fails. As we come to you through Jesus, we ask for your mercy and help with everything we need. Let your Spirit work in us to grow love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
- **Growing Up**: Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day.
- **Sermon**: Dear God,of all the people in the world you have chosen us. We were lost and trapped in our sin and rebellion, but in your Son you have destroyed our sin and raised us with Him as a new people. Thank you for your compassion and kindness, humility and gentleness, your patience and forbearance. We praise you for loving us. By your Spirit, adorn us, your church this beautiful garment of Christ-likeness. So that all may see your beauty and glory. Amen. 

When the things of our old life knock on the door of our hearts—whether it be anger, greed, or impurity—please help us to remember that Jesus is now our life. Help us to keep opening the door to compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience, knowing that Christ now lives in us.
Help us to grow in holiness, not just as individuals, but as a community. May we be known for our kindness, gentleness, and patience, both within our families and to the world around us. Strengthen us to bear with one another, forgive as You have forgiven us, and do all things in love. In Jesus’ name, we pray. Amen.

## Mission Related Prayer Points
- **Berkeley Life Centre:**
  Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain times and places so that they may find you. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast their burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background, rely on public housing, face domestic violence and face all kinds of addictions will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. Please sustain Rev. Wayne Pickford and the team as they lead the church to be a light and witness in their community. We pray for Wayne and the family as they come to terms with the recent diagnosis of Wayne’s Parkinson’s disease. May they have wisdom, patience and hope as they think about the future and await tests. May you keep sustaining and working through Berkeley Life Centre both now and into the future. We praise you for providing Samantha Trotter who is helping with the womens and children ministry. May there be more kids and families who come to be transformed by the gospel. May the Frozen Meals Ministry, Community BBQ and movie nights be an avenue for the church to care for those struggling and hear the good news. May Glenn, Inter Pastor, grow in his conviction, character and competence as he continues The Well Training Program and studies the Pentateuch. Please provide for the ministry financially. 
- **Empowering Everyone with English in Jesus’ Name:** 
  We praise you for the many people groups that are in Hurstville including from Nepal, Thailand, Latin America, Mongolia and China. May we have a heart for them to settle and live well in Australia and more importantly to find their true citizenship in Jesus. May the teachers and volunteers be a model of love and good works as they teach people about Jesus and English amidst sicknesses and illness amongst them and their families. May the students be connected with other church activities and to Jesus. Please help our new teachers (Amy and Louisa) to settle and love well. 
- **CanCare:** Father God, we praise you for you are the God of compassion and love. You know what it means to face trials and pain and that you can sympathise with our weaknesses. We thank you that you use CanCare to support people and their family and friends who are or have suffered from the ravages of cancer, and to serve them with Christ's love and to accompany them in this difficult fight against cancer.  May God continue to lead the Cancare team and give them the wisdom to provide care for this cohort in unity. May God bless those suffering from cancer with His peace. We continue to pray for another upcoming drama public event at Hurstville Club Central in September. May God guide all the preparation work and provide all resources that they may need. Bless the event so that it doesn't just make a positive impact on lives but also draw the non-believers to Christ.
- **Evangelism Teams and Programs:** Gracious Lord, our neighbours are lost and far away from you. We long for the opportunity to proclaim your name. Please give us the eyes to see those whom you have placed before us. Whenever I open my mouth, may words be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel. We pray that as the seeds of the gospel are scattered and planted, that they would land on good soil. Please make them bear fruit, Father. Scare away the crows. Crush the rocks. Strangle the weeds. Instead, give us rich healthy soil ready to receive the seeds of the gospel. In Jesus’ name, we pray.
