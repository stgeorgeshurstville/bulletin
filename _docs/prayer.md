| **From the Passage** |  

| **Mission and Vision** | <br><br> *Shine for Jesus, Everywhere, Anytime:*
Heavenly Father, Equip us with the wisdom and courage to be Your light in every corner of our lives—in our homes, workplaces, schools, and in the Hurstville community. Strengthen our commitment to proclaim Christ's glory, not just in our services, but in our daily actions. Help us to consistently reflect the love, truth, and grace of Jesus, so that those who do not yet know Him may be drawn to His saving light. Empower our ministries—English, Chinese, Nepali, and all future works—to boldly embody this vision. May we be a church that never hides its lamp, but shines brightly for Your name's sake. Amen.

| **Global and Nation** | <br><br> *Government*: Almighty God, we pray for our government in Australia. You have appointed leaders to uphold justice and bring peace. Grant wisdom and integrity to our Prime Minister, members of Parliament, and all in authority, that they may serve the people with fairness and compassion, especially the vulnerable and marginalized. As our nation faces economic, social, and international challenges, guide them to make decisions that align with Your truth and goodness. Raise up faithful men and women in government to be salt and light, bringing righteousness and hope to our nation. In Jesus’ name we pray, Amen.


| **Mission Partners** | <br><br> *Mellisa Wang at Focus Adelaide:*
FOCUS is a group for international students at Adelaide Uni. Mellisa seeks to support their student committee in running the group's weekly activities. She also meets one to one with female students to disciple them through reading the Bible and prayer. These are some prayer points and prayers from her latest Newsletter
*1.  For Fiona (New Christian)*
- **Context:** Fiona is a recent convert who put her faith in Jesus after the Mid Year Conference (MYC) and has had a huge hunger for God's word ever since. 
- **Prayer:** "Please keep praying that God's power will guard Fiona through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."

*2. Students: Shifting Focus to God's Eternal Will*
- **Context:** Many students, especially international ones, are anxious about their uncertain future (jobs, visa status) and devote their energy to temporary goals, building a "sandcastle" life that will not last. They need to be reoriented to trust God's plans and live for His kingdom instead of their own anxieties.
- **Prayer:** "Father, you are the giver of life and all good gifts. Please help students to recognise this and enjoy the gift of life, friends, study, and everything. But please let them take your word of warning to heart and not live for this life. Help them to fear you and keep your commandments. Thank you for giving us your word and Spirit to guide us. Please help FOCUS students to seek, know, and live for your will. Please grow their trust in your plans, especially when their plans seem to be failing. Please help them to desire holiness, and let their greatest longing be Jesus and for others to know Jesus."

*3. New Christian Students* 
- **Context:** The ministry is seeing new interest, with both newly arrived Christian students considering moving interstate for visa reasons and several non-Christian students like Rhys and Lucy showing openness to Jesus by attending the Bible study group. The ministry also needs a faithful, teachable group of students to form next year's committee.
- **Prayer:** "Father, please be guiding the newly arrived students to make decisions that will enable them to grow in faith, love, trust and godliness. Please provide a faithful and teachable group of students for next year's committee. Thank you for bringing Rhys and other unbelievers to Friday nights. Please work in their hearts so they'd be willing to learn more about Jesus through reading a Gospel. Please help Rhys to see the hope and love Jesus has to offer to him. Please give Lucy a curiosity to meet Jesus."

<br><br> | **Church Ministries** | <br><br> *Youth:*
Loving Lord, we place our young people into Your hands. As they take a break from school, please protect their minds, bodies, and spirits, keeping them safe from temptation and harm. May their times of rest, fun, and friendship also be filled with Your presence. Stir their hearts to draw closer to You in prayer, in reading the Bible, and through fellowship with the church. Grant them renewal and strength during this holiday so they may return ready to face the new term with faith and wisdom. Through Jesus Christ our Lord we pray, Amen.
