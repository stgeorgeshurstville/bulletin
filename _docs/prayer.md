## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Collect**: Almighty and merciful God, of your bountiful goodness keep us from everything that may hurt us, that we may be ready in body and soul cheerfully to accomplish whatever you want us to do; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus**: Dear God, our loving and kind Father, you are full of grace and patience, and you always love us. You are holy and fair, but you never turn away from those who look for you. We feel safe and comforted with you, our God. We trust you with our lives and know your love never fails. As we come to you through Jesus, we ask for your mercy and help with everything we need. Let your Spirit work in us to grow love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.

- **Growing Up**: Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day. 

- **Sermon**: We praise you that the Lord is near and that we have the peace of God that transcends all understanding. We praise you for guarding our hearts and minds in Christ. We praise you for who you are, what you have done and will do. May we not be anxious. But in all situations and at all times pray, petition and present our requests to you. May we be thankful for who Jesus and what we have in him. Amen.

- **Berkeley Life Centre**: Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain times and places so that they may find you. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast their burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background, rely on public housing, face domestic violence and face all kinds of addictions will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. Please sustain Rev. Wayne Pickford and the team as they lead the church to be a light and witness in their community. We pray for Wayne and the family as they come to terms with the recent diagnosis of Wayne’s Parkinson’s disease. May they have wisdom, patience and hope as they think about the future and await tests. May you keep sustaining and working through Berkeley Life Centre both now and into the future. May the Pickford family have a good break. We praise you for providing Samantha Trotter who is helping with the womens and children ministry. May there be more kids and families who come to be transformed by the gospel. May you provide someone to look after the Op Shop as Kay spends more time to look after her husband who is unwell.

- **Empowering Everyone with English in Jesus’ Name**: We praise you for the many people groups that are in Hurstville including from Nepal, Thailand, Latin America, Mongolia and China. May we have a heart for them to settle and live well in Australia and more importantly to find their true citizenship in Jesus. May the teachers and volunteers be a model of love and good works as they teach people about Jesus and English amidst sicknesses, surgeries and illness amongst them and their families. May the students be connected with other church activities and to Jesus. 

- **Evangelism Teams and Programs**: Gracious Lord, our neighbours are lost and far away from you. We long for the opportunity to proclaim your name. Please give us the eyes to see those whom you have placed before us. Whenever I open my mouth, may words be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel. We pray that as the seeds of the gospel are scattered and planted, that they would land on good soil. Please make them bear fruit, Father. Scare away the crows. Crush the rocks. Strangle the weeds. Instead, give us rich healthy soil ready to receive the seeds of the gospel. In Jesus’ name, we pray.
