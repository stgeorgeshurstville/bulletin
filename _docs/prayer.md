| **From the Passage** | **Adoration**<br><br>Heavenly Father, we arise and give you glory, for you are the Everlasting Light that no darkness can overcome. We praise you as the Great Creator who spoke light into the void, and as the Great Redeemer who shines your face upon a broken world. You are the Architect of a city whose gates never shut, a sanctuary where violence is heard no more, and where your presence is our eternal sun.<br><br>**Confession**<br><br>Lord, we confess that we often grope in the darkness like those without eyes. We confess that our own hands have been stained and our hearts have been prone to the very shadows we deplore. Like the people of Judah, we acknowledge that our nature apart from you produces only separation. Forgive us for trying to manufacture a fragile peace through fear and force rather than seeking the peace that comes from your Spirit.<br><br>**Thanksgiving**<br><br>We thank you, Lord Jesus, that you are the True Temple. We thank you that you did not stay distant but became the "Light of the World" who was "torn apart" on the cross so that we might never be torn apart from you. Thank you for the Servant" who donned the breastplate of righteousness to fight for us, not to destroy us, but to redeem us. We thank you for the gift of your Word and your Spirit, which pierce our hearts and make us a new creation.<br><br>We look forward with hope to the day when the sun and moon are no longer needed, for you will be our glory. Help to keep longing for the arrival of the New Jerusalem from heaven where we get to be in your presence forever. But until then, help us to arise and shine and to do your will. We pray all this in the name of the Lamb, the light of the City of God, Jesus Christ<br><br> **Amen.** |

We thank you specifically for her story—the powerful testimony of how you reached into the darkness and brought her from death to life. We praise you that you didn't just save her from sin, but saved her for a purpose, transforming her heart to live entirely for your glory. We thank you that you have placed a fire in her soul to make the name of Jesus known among the international students at Adelaide University.<br><br>**For Rest and Renewal**<br><br>Lord, we thank you for the gift of the summer months. We praise you for the rest Melissa is experiencing right now after a year of diligent, hard work on campus.

Fill her cup to overflowing so that she is ready and eager for the mission ahead.<br><br>**For the Mission at FOCUS**<br><br>As the new academic year approaches, we lift up the FOCUS ministry.
