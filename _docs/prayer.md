**Prayer**

Heavenly Father,
We thank you, for the immeasurable gift of being part of your family. We rejoice in the fellowship we share with our brothers, mothers, and sisters in faith as we all strive to do your will. But Lord, we know there is a tendency to think of you differently, to accuse you as someone you are not, to ask of you things we should not, or to be ashamed of being associated with you. For those times, we ask for your grace that welcomes us back home into your family. Amen.
