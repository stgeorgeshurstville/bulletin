## Collect
Almighty Father, whose blessed Son was revealed so that he might destroy the works of the devil and make us the children of God and heirs of eternal life: grant that having this hope we may purify ourselves as he is pure; that, when he shall appear again with power and great glory, we may be made like him in his eternal and glorious kingdom, where with you, Father, and with the Holy Spirit, he lives and reigns, one God, for evermore. Amen.

| **From the Passage** | Heavenly Father,<br><br>Thank you for inviting us to be with you.  Thank you that no one needs to miss out.<br><br> We often think being “lucky” means having things,  and we forget that having you is everything.<br><br>Thank you for Jesus, your Servant,  who opens the way for outsiders, for sinners,for people like us to be with your Father.<br><br>Teach us to rest,  to trust you,  and to delight in you. Make our holy days truly holy.  Help us to worship,  to love,  to serve,  and to remind one another  that we are your children, Jesus is our brother,  and heaven is our home.<br><br>As we wait for that great future with you,  help us to live your way now —  with justice, righteousness, and joy. Help us to invite others to join us on this Holiday.<br><br>We pray this in Jesus’ name.<br><br> **Amen.** |
| **Mission and Vision** | **Berkeley Life Centre (BLC)** <br><br>Gracious Father, we lift up our brothers and sisters at Berkeley Life Centre. We thank You for their heart to depend on You as they serve a community facing deep hardship. We join our hearts with theirs in prayer:<br><br> *For the Mission and Discipleship:* Lord, we pray for the primary goal of bringing the Good News to Berkeley and its growing Muslim community. Strengthen BLC in their mission to make disciples and equip leaders. May every member be developed and equipped to become a more Christlike version of themselves.<br><br> *For the Op Shop and Volunteers:* We thank You for the Op Shop, providing quality clothing and food sourced from Anglicare and partner churches. Lord, send more Christian volunteers—not just to sort and sell, but to have "Jesus conversations" and offer love to those seeking companionship.|

| **Mission Partners** | *Persecuted Christians*<br><br> *Please reflect on your own prayer* <br><br> *Phil & Lil in West Asia* <br><br> Phil and Lil do ministry work for Wycliffe Bible Translators for the people in West Asia. As of a few months ago, Phil and Lil had to come back to Australia but are still working remotely as they continue this work. Here are their latest prayer points for November and December: <br><br>**Praise God:** Lil had an encouraging time at the prayer conference in Indonesia last month. It was a great time of fellowship, networking, and intercession for the M world. Lil was also encouraged by the opportunity to share some of the materials she wrote and to share how she prays for "countries at war" in one of the workshops. <br><br>**Courier Issues:** When we left West Asia, we sent several boxes of books, clothes, and toys by courier. Two boxes still have not arrived due to a dispute between the courier and their local contact. Ask that the problem would be resolved and the boxes delivered soon. <br><br>**Translation Project:** Ask that the Greek Interlinear New Testament team would continue to work well, and that the Lord would guide Phil and the team in their decisions as they check different books. Phil will travel to meet with them from 12–17 January. Ask that these meetings would be effective in moving the project toward completion. <br><br>**Family Transitions:** Ask that Susannah and Joanna would have a good break before school starts and settle into their new school well.| 
| **Church Ministries** |*CanCare* <br><br> Heavenly Father, we praise You for Your mercy and kindness. You understand the trials and suffering we face and are compassionate toward our weaknesses. We thank You for raising up CanCare Centre to support those who are currently battling or have overcome cancer, along with their families and friends. Through Christ’s love, they serve and walk alongside them on this challenging journey. As 2025 draws to a close, we are grateful for how You have supported the various ministries of CanCare Centre through a team of dedicated volunteers, prayer warriors, and friends who have quietly provided financial support. May You personally remember and reward their selfless dedication andloving contributions. During this summer break, we pray that You grant them ample rest and spiritual renewal, so that in the coming year, they may continue to shine for You in their respective roles, accompanying those battling cancer with the love of Christ as they walk this journey together. <br><br> *Nursing home / Pastoral Care Teams* <br><br> Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You for watching over every elderly person throughout this past year with Your grace and hope. You know the burdens and needs in each of their hearts. We ask that You continue to comfort them by Your mighty hand and help them to fix their eyes on You alone, finding true peace and blessing in Your presence. Whether they are living in nursing homes or receiving special care at home, may they experience more deeply Your love and abiding presence in their daily lives. Lord, we also thank You for using every member involved in care and visitation ministry throughout this year. Please continue to use them as channels of Your love. Through each visit, moment of companionship, and act of care, may those who are visited experience the joy of fellowship, the warmth of being remembered, and the hope that comes from You. As we look ahead, we pray that You would continue to guide this ministry. Grant strength, compassion, and wisdom, so that all our service may glorify Your name and become a blessing in the lives of the elderly.|
