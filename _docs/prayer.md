## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** Heavenly Father, the giver of all good things, fill our hearts with thankfulness, and grant that by your holy inspiration we may think those things that are good, and by your merciful guidance may perform them; through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus**: Loving and compassionate Father, You are full of grace and kindness, patient and overflowing with love and faithfulness. Your holiness and fairness shine brightly, yet you never turn away from those who seek you. We find our safety and comfort in you, our God. Our lives are entrusted to your care, and we trust in your unfailing love. O faithful God, as we come before your throne of grace through Jesus, we humbly ask for your mercy and grace to meet our every need. May your Spirit work within us, producing in us the beautiful fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In the precious name of your beloved Son, we pray. Amen.
- **Saviour:** God of all grace, You have given me a Savior. Grant me the faith to rely on Him completely, making Him my desire, hope, and glory. May I find refuge in Him, build my life upon His teachings, and walk in His ways. Let me follow His example, heed His guidance, and trust in His intercession. May I never be ashamed of Him, but proudly bear His name and teachings. Keep me from being swayed by the world's allurements or frightened by its threats. Help me to remember that this world is not my home, but that I am a pilgrim seeking a heavenly country. May I grow daily in readiness for that eternal home, and may all I do be done in the name of the Savior. Amen.
- **Sermon**: We thank you our Heavenly Father that our hope is in the grace brought to us with the appearing of Jesus Christ. Thank you that we were redeemed from our empty way of life not with perishable things like gold and silver but with the precious blood of Jesus, a lamb without blemish or defect, chosen before the creation of the world and revealed in these last days for our sake. We thank you that you have purified us through the word of truth about Jesus. Please help us to hold fast to and to hold out that Word of Truth. As your word goes out through us: may it accomplish what you desire and achieve the purpose for which you have sent it. Amen.

## Mission Partner Focus
- **Persecuted Christians:** We thank you for sending Jesus who is sovereign and came to save the world by sacrificing himself. Please give patience and perseverance to those who are being persecuted for the faith. May they be an model and example of what it means to have a calling in life and a confidence for the future. May they seek to do the will of you rather than themselves. May there be justice. If this isn’t achieved, may they keep looking to you as the judge and respond with love rather than revenge.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **World**: We pray that you will lead the nations of the world in the ways of righteousness and peace. Please guide our rulers in wisdom and justice. May there be tranquillity so that we can live godly and holy lives and people can come to the knowledge of the truth. May we submit to those you’ve placed in authority and ultimately to your reign and rule. May people live and long for the new world to come rather than seek to gain the world and forfeit our souls. 
- **Redevelopment**: Our Gracious God and Heavenly Father, You know our needs. You have richly provided and we know that you will continue to provide what we need for the mission that you have called us to. May our faithful stewardship bear witness to the love of Jesus Christ in our lives. We pray this in the name of the one who is building us into a spiritual house for a holy priesthood and to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to you.
- **Sunday Services**: Thank you heavenly Father for our ascended King. Thank you for the gifts of apostles, evangelists, pastors, teachers, service leaders, musicians and all those who serve us. We pray that you will use their service for the building up of the church, that we may reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of your Son and become mature. We ask this for Bible readers, service leaders, musicians, welcomers and other volunteers. 
- **Staff and Parish Council**: We praise you for the leaders you’ve appointed over us. May they love and care for the church of God which you obtained with your own blood. May they prayerfully set forth the life giving word through their lives and teaching. Clothe them with holiness, zeal and servant heartedness. We pray for our wardens and parish councillors, may they have wisdom, insight and passion to see our church family be spiritually transformed for your glory. Please use them to help us stay focused and accountable with the resources you’ve given us. 
- **English Congregations**: May we have Jesus as the centre of our lives in 2023. May God use our programs and plans to see us deepen our trust, have a personal relationship with God and have a faith that is public. 
- **Families**: We remember the families of our church community. We pray that despite the busyness, you will be an ever presence and comfort to them. Please help kids and their families to set the right priorities, the discipline to say ‘no’. May our love for and devotion to you be our greatest desire. Help parents and spiritual uncles and aunties to impart the knowledge of you and of your love; and children to respond with love and obedience. We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
