## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** Almighty and everlasting God, you have given us your servants grace by the confession of a true faith to acknowledge the glory of the eternal Trinity, and by your divine power to worship you as One: we humbly pray that you would keep us steadfast in this faith and evermore defend us from all adversities; through Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Loving and compassionate Father, You are full of grace and kindness, patient and overflowing with love and faithfulness. Your holiness and fairness shine brightly, yet you never turn away from those who seek you. We find our safety and comfort in you, our God. Our lives are entrusted to your care, and we trust in your unfailing love. O faithful God, as we come before your throne of grace through Jesus, we humbly ask for your mercy and grace to meet our every need. May your Spirit work within us, producing in us the beautiful fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In the precious name of your beloved Son, we pray. Amen.
- **Jesus' Love:** Father of Jesus, Help me to approach you with deep reverence, not with presumption or fear, but with confidence. Though I cannot fully comprehend you, I love you deeply, for you are supremely good and perfect. The love of Jesus, my brother, overwhelms me. His sacrifice and resurrection bind us together. In him, I find my true identity and purpose. Yet, my love often feels cold and distant. May his love warm my heart, lighten my burdens and be my guiding light. Let the overwhelming love of Jesus cover my sins and worries and allow me to rise above the challenges of life. May I become more fruitful by living in his love and growing daily in character and beauty. Lord Jesus, dwell within me. Divine Spirit, rest upon me. Holy Father, look upon me with mercy for the sake of your beloved Son. Amen.
- **Growing Out:** Our gracious Father, thank you that the Gospel is the power of salvation to all people. Thank you that even now the Gospel has come to us, it is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world. We pray that many in our generation will hear and truly understand you grace. Please help us to be godly in life, resilient in ministry, servant-hearted, Biblical in life, thought and ministry, and able to love and minister faithfully, compassionately and effectively in different and changing contexts, cooperating with one another, humble, wise, prayerful, reflective, energetic and effective. Please help us to take our faith in Jesus beyond the walls of the church into our workplace, school, where we live and where we holiday. Please help us to have a compassion for the lost like Jesus. Please help us to be willing to go into the world, to be interested in the lives of people we meet. Please give us opportunities to represent Jesus and to speak of Him. Please give us the words to say. Please save our neighbours through us.
- **Sermon:** We deserve your justice and judgement. We praise you for giving us a new future through the new covenant. We praise you for Jesus who allows us to be in this new covenant through his sacrifice and the sending of the Spirit. We praise you that we can be your people, know you, be forgiven and have your law written on our hearts and minds. May we willingly, joyfully and zealously live for you. Amen.  

## Weekly Prayer Points

## Mission Partner Focus

- **Local High School Scripture:** Loving Father, we thank you that you want all people to come to a saving knowledge of you. We ask that the high schoolers in our area (especially at Hurstville Boys, Sydney Tech and Oatley High) will see Jesus as the way, the truth and the life. May you help students to find their identity and security in Jesus particularly when things get busy, life doesn’t work out as planned and the future may seem confusing and meaningless. We praise you for providing Semi Kolikata to replace Aywan Suleiman. Please help him to transition well, make good connections with the school and students and share the good news.
- **Papua New Guinea and Mathys:** Father God, we realise that all flesh is like grass yet your word remains forever. We ask that you will use the Mathys and other bible translators to transform PNG for Jesus with your precious and powerful word. We pray that the Mathys and their children Petra, Andi and Jakob will keep growing in Christ and being missional. May the 17 million people in PNG come to know Christ as their Lord and Saviour.

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Hurstville:** We pray that the 30,000 people in Hurstville, with many from different cultures and countries, will come to know Jesus as their Lord and Saviour. May we have a heart for the people you have placed around us. May we be lights in our neighbourhood which is in darkness and filled with anxiety and uncertainty. May we be mindful of the changing demographics and seek to share the gospel with them. May Chris Minns (NSW Premier and Legislative Assembly Member for Kogarah), Linda Burney (House Representative for Barton), David Coleman (House Representative for Banks) and Nick Katris (Mayor) know who has the ultimate authority and steward with love, justice and wisdom. 
- **Discipleship Groups:** We praise you for the opportunity to study your word together and grow as disciples of Jesus. May we have clear direction, wisdom and discipline as we spur each other to have a secure attachment in Jesus.
- **Pastoral Care Team:** Father, you sent your Son to heal the brokenhearted. May we cast our burdens and anxieties upon you knowing that you can sympathise with our weaknesses and care for us. May the peace of God sustain us as we bear the hope of the gospel, point people to heaven and carry each other’s burdens.
- **People with Disabilities:** Thank you that all people are made in your image. We pray for those with disabilities that they would know their true value as your image-bearer. We pray that your love in Jesus will heal them of their experience and rejection and pain. We pray that they will know of Jesus’ sufficiency in their experience of chronic pain and suffering. We pray for forgiveness for the ways that we have often treated people with disabilities. Please help us to be like Jesus in welcoming those with disabilities into our church and lives. Please open our eyes to see them as whole human beings. Please help us to learn from those with disabilities as well as minister to them. We pray that by our love for one another, the world may see you. We look forward to the day when Jesus returns, when we will be given Resurrection bodies. Amen.
- **Support Ministries:** Everlasting God, we give thanks for the many volunteers who have been faithfully serving in different ministries at church. Please strengthen and sustain them with patience and understanding that they may love and care for your people. Please grant that together they may follow and help others to follow Jesus Christ. May they offer their gifts and talents to build up the church which is the body of Christ. We ask this for the communication, vestry, cleaning, flower, bulletin, meals, AV, sound, technology and the many other teams. May people come under the wings of your love and salvation.
- **New Life Nepalese Church:** We thank you for our Nepalese brothers and sisters who share our building. May they grow in their knowledge of your love for them and continue to speak the truth in love to their community. We pray that through their ministry, many more Nepalese would come to serve the Lord Jesus Christ. May they embrace people from all cultural backgrounds, ⁠⁠grow in faith as well as in numbers and have more labourers to spread the good news of the kingdom of God. 
- **Singles, Widows and Orphans:** We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
