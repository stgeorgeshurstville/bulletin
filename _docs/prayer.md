We beseech you, almighty God, to look in mercy on your people: that by your great goodness they may be governed and preserved evermore; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.



## Week 1 (first Sunday of the month)

### From the passage ###
**From Matthew 16:**
Heavenly Father,
You alone are God, and salvation is found in Christ alone. We thank You for revealing Jesus to us—not just as a wise teacher or miracle worker, but as the Messiah, the Son of the living God, the King of Your eternal kingdom. 

Yet, Lord, in trying to gain the world, we have forsaken our Lord. Forgive us. We have sought comfort over costly discipleship, approval over obedience, and control over surrender. Protect us from the poison of a sign-seeking, self-justifying, self-glorifying faith. Expose the ways we twist Your truth to serve our own desires rather than bowing before Christ as Lord. 

Help us to see ever more clearly the sufficiency of Jesus, that we may trust Him completely and take up our cross daily. Strip away our pride, our fears, and our love for this world, and fix our eyes on the One who endured the cross for our sake. 

Thank You that in Jesus, You have revealed Your glory—not in earthly power but in self-giving, sacrificial love. Through His rejection, suffering, and death, You have brought us life. And through His resurrection, You have triumphed over sin and death. 

Lord, only Jesus—Jesus alone—can change our stone-like hearts. Shape us into true disciples, followers who do not merely admire Christ from a distance but who are willing to lose our lives for His sake. Help us to forsake the fleeting treasures of this world and embrace the eternal riches of Your kingdom. Strengthen us to live not for ourselves but for Jesus and His church, a people redeemed for Your glory. 

We ask all this in the precious name of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour. 

Amen.

### Special items & events ###
**From Darkness to Dawn - Easter weekend:**
Heavenly Father, we lift up our Easter services to you. We pray that your Holy Spirit would draw many newcomers to hear the life-giving message of the Gospel. Open their hearts to understand the death and resurrection of Jesus, moving them from spiritual darkness into the dawn of your saving grace. 

**For Myanmar:** “I love you, O LORD, my strength. The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge.” (Psalm 18:1-2) 

You are the God of all comfort, sovereign over all creation. We come to you today with heavy hearts for all those affected by the earthquake in Myanmar and Thailand. 

We ask for your protection for all impacted by the earthquake, especially those needing to be rescued, medical assistance, and emergency aid. We pray for those displaced, injured, and mourning. We pray for comfort and strength for those who have lost homes, possessions, and livelihood. Please help them as they look to you in their times of trouble. Hear their cry for help in their time of affliction. Help them to find hope in Jesus, in the depths of their despair. 

We pray for those involved in the rescue operation and emergency efforts. We pray for the ministry of the Anglican church in Myanmar, as they bring hope and help to those made vulnerable by this disaster. Give them the physical and emotional fortitude to continue their selfless efforts. May the name of Jesus be praised through their efforts. 

Please be with Archbishop Stephen Than, Bishop David Nyi Nyi of Mandalay Diocese, Bishop John Zau Li of Myitkyina Diocese, and Bishop Alan Kyan Myo Naing of Homalin Diocese, along with their clergy and laity, as they demonstrate the love of Jesus to those affected. 

In Jesus' name, we pray.
