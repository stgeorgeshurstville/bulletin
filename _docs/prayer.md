## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.

- **Collect:** Father in heaven, keep your household the church steadfast in faith and love, that through your protection it may be free from all adversities, and may devoutly serve you in good works to the glory of your name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

- **Mission**: Our gracious Father, thank you for the privilege of calling us to join in your mission. Thank you that under you what we do makes a difference in the world. We pray therefore that you will save those around us and to transform them into the likeness of Jesus. Please use us to make disciples of the nations, love our neighbours. Please Father, glorify yourself, through our labour in your Son. We pray that we will not be consumers but contributors to the ministries that you have called us to.
- **Church Sermon**: Father, as Adam’s children we were dead in our sins and hopeless. We praise you for raising your Son up from the dead for all to see and destroying all dominion, authority and power. We praise you that God will be all in all. We thank you that our faith is not futile, the sting of death is gone and our labour in the Lord is not in vain. May we stand firm and labour fully in the Lord. Amen. 



## Weekly Prayer Points
- **Conflict in the middle east**: God of the nations, whose kingdom rules over all, have mercy on our broken and divided world. In the land of our Saviour’s birth, banish the spirit that makes for war. Please give wisdom to those you have placed in authority, rescue the captives, shield those in danger, and bind up the broken hearted. For those fighting for justice, may they be strengthened by your grace. For those walking in darkness, may the light of your face shine upon them. Above all, we pray that the people of Israel and the Middle East will find everlasting hope in you. And in the land of your Son’s redeeming death and resurrection, turn hearts to look to the Saviour and live. Bring peace, Lord, while we wait for Christ's coming and rule, when all people will beat their swords into plowshares, when nation will not take up sword against nation, and when every tear will be wiped away by the Prince of Peace and Lord of Lords, Amen

- **St Andrew’s Cathedral School**: God of all mercy, giver of all comfort: when we cannot understand the things that happen, and are weighed down by loss and loneliness, uphold us in your love. Look graciously, we pray, on those in grief, pain, and confusion, especially the victim's family, whose loss is so keen, together with the whole St Andrew’s Cathedral and Danebank Anglican School community: for students, teachers, other staff, alumni, and also their families. We pray specifically for Head of Schools, Dr Julie McGonigle and Dr Emma Burgess, for her Executive team and for the school Chaplains, called to lead the School community through this time of trouble: grant them depths of wisdom, compassion and resilience. We pray also for students with final HSC and IB exams coping with this additional stress. Casting all their cares on you, may each member of the School community know the consolation of your love. Give us all the assurance of your constant care, that we may have courage for the days ahead. We pray in the name of our Friend and Saviour, the only one to promise to wipe every tear from our eyes, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen

- **HSC Exams (11 Oct-3 Nov)** May they (and their families) have strength, wisdom, calmness, purpose and the peace of God. May they be able to do their best and be comforted in knowing that their identity is in Christ. 

- **Indigenous Australians:** Holy Father, God of Love, You are the Creator of this land and of all good things. Our hope is in you because you gave your Son Jesus to reconcile the world to you. We pray for your strength and grace to forgive, accept and love one another, as you love us and forgive and accept us in the sacrifice of your Son. Give us the courage to accept the realities of our history so that we may build a better future for our nation. Teach us to respect all cultures. Teach us to care for our land and waters. Help us to share justly the resources of this land. Help us to bring about spiritual and social change to improve the quality of life for all groups in our communities, especially the disadvantaged. Help young people to find true dignity and self esteem by your Spirit. May your power and love be the foundations on which we build our families, our communities and our nation, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
  
- **Reformation Day**: Father, we can’t take credit for the faith which enabled me to receive gospel-righteousness. This too is a gift from you, Lord Jesus! So on this Reformation Day, I once again affirm that my hope is built on nothing less, nothing more, and nothing other than Jesus’ blood and your righteousness. All other ground is sinking sand. Keep bringing me back to the gospel; keep bringing me back to the gospel plus nothing, as my everything.

## Mission Related Prayer Points
- **Compassion**: Jesus came to seek and to save the lost. You tell us that true religion is to visit orphans and widows in their affliction. May Compassion Australia seek to release children from poverty in Jesus’ name. May we do what we can to love children and their families so that they will mature physically, mentally, socially and most importantly spiritually. May we prayerfully invest in the lives of the children in Sumba Indonesia and see a whole region won and living for God. May you give wisdom to our 11 partner churches in the area to love and care for the children. May these children have enough sustenance, health and support as they participate in the program and activities. For those who personally sponsor a child, may we keep praying, communicating and supporting them and their family. 
- **Persecuted Christians**: We thank you for sending Jesus who is sovereign and came to save the world by sacrificing himself. Please give patience and perseverance to those who are being persecuted for the faith. May they be a model and example of what it means to have a calling in life and a confidence for the future. May they seek to do the will of you rather than themselves. May there be justice. If this isn’t achieved, may they keep looking to you as the judge and respond with love rather than revenge.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Volunteers**: Everlasting God, we give thanks for the many volunteers who have been faithfully serving in different ministries at church. Thank God for those who have responded to the serving survey recently indicating they are willing to start serving or to serve more.  Please strengthen and sustain all the volunteers with patience and understanding that they may love and care for your people. Please grant that together they may follow Jesus Christ, offer you their given gifts and talents, and build up the church, the body of Christ.
- **World**: We pray that you will lead the nations of the world in the ways of righteousness and peace. Please guide our rulers in wisdom and justice. May there be tranquillity so that we can live godly and holy lives and people can come to the knowledge of the truth. May we submit to those you’ve placed in authority and ultimately to your reign and rule. May people live and long for the new world to come rather than seek to gain the world and forfeit our souls. 
- **Redevelopment**: Our Gracious God and Heavenly Father, You know our needs. You have richly provided and we know that you will continue to provide what we need for the mission that you have called us to. May our faithful stewardship bear witness to the love of Jesus Christ in our lives. We pray this in the name of the one who is building us into a spiritual house for a holy priesthood and to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to you.
- **Sunday Services**: Thank you heavenly Father for our ascended King. Thank you for the gifts of apostles, evangelists, pastors, teachers, service leaders, musicians and all those who serve us. We pray that you will use their service for the building up of the church, that we may reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of your Son and become mature. We ask this for Bible readers, service leaders, musicians, welcomers and other volunteers. 
- **Staff and Parish Council**: We praise you for the leaders you’ve appointed over us. May they love and care for the church of God which you obtained with your own blood. May they prayerfully set forth the life giving word through their lives and teaching. Clothe them with holiness, zeal and servant heartedness. We pray for our wardens and parish councillors, may they have wisdom, insight and passion to see our church family be spiritually transformed for your glory. Please use them to help us stay focused and accountable with the resources you’ve given us. 
- **English Congregations**: May we have Jesus as the centre of our lives in 2023. May God use our programs and plans to see us deepen our trust, have a personal relationship with God and have a faith that is public. 
- **Families**: We remember the families of our church community. We pray that despite the busyness, you will be an ever presence and comfort to them. Please help kids and their families to set the right priorities, the discipline to say ‘no’. May our love for and devotion to you be our greatest desire. We bow our knees before you the Father from whom every family is named. Help parents and spiritual uncles and aunties to impart the knowledge of you and of your love; and children to respond with love and obedience. We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
