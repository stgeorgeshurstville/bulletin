## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** Almighty God, whose never-failing providence governs all things in heaven and earth: we humbly ask you to put away from us all hurtful things, and to give us whatever may be profitable for us; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Dear God, our loving and kind Father, you are full of grace and patience, and you always love us. You are holy and fair, but you never turn away from those who look for you. We feel safe and comforted with you, our God. We trust you with our lives and know your love never fails. As we come to you through Jesus, we ask for your mercy and help with everything we need. Let your Spirit work in us to grow love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
- **Growing deep**: Oh Lord, how we love your law! Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path. Thank you that Jesus has given us the Word of Eternal Life. Thank you that heaven and earth may pass away but our Lord’s words will never pass away. Please help us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds by your Word. Please help us to deepen our understanding of and obedience to your Word. 
- **Sermon**: 
Dear Jesus, thank you for the gift of friendship. For people who have welcomed us and made us feel comfortable. For people that will put up with us and make us feel safe to be myself. People who will listen to us. People that I laugh with and cry with. People who stand by us even when life is difficult. People who will overlook our mistakes and bad choices. People who care about us enough to tell us the truth. 
We thank you for christian friends. People who I can pray with and read the Bible with and sing with. People who inspire me with their faith and love. People who will serve me and allow me to serve. People I can battle the world, sin and the flesh with. People who will cheer me on and carry my burdens with me. 
We haven’t been the friends that we should’ve been. We have made ourselves and what we want more important than them. We have gossiped. We have been slow to listen and understand and quick to give advice. 
We grieve with those who long for friendship but can’t find any. 
Thank you for making us your enemies to be your friends. Thank you for being our one true friend. Thank you that you won’t unfriend us when we prove to be unworthy. Thank you that our problems, struggles, suffering and sin draws you closer to us. 
We wish everyone knows that you want to be their friend.  
We look forward to spending eternity with you enjoying our friendship forever. Amen.


## Weekly Prayer Points

## Mission Partner Focus
- **JC in SE Asia:** You call us to make and mature disciples of all nations. We ask that you’ll allow JC to courageously, lovingly and prayerfully share the gospel in a country where evangelism is not allowed and even publicly practicing one’s faith is difficult. May you soften the hearts of the authorities and the people so that they’ll hear and accept the peace, purpose and real spiritual prosperity in Jesus. May you raise up Christians and leaders in the university and church. May you save JC’s immediate and extended family.

## Regular Prayer Points
**- Government:** You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May they enact laws and initiatives so that the orphans, widows and harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit to their authority as we hold out the word of life and ultimately submit to you. 
**- Children:** Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow their hearts to love Jesus and become more like Him each day. Give strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to genuinely love the kids and show them Jesus.
**- Youth**: Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength and security in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness and at times feelings of hopelessness. May we be a safe and respectful environment where youths can explore their questions and find true meaning. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities and temptations. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness. May they have a secure attachment to Jesus especially as we go through different beliefs and behaviours that may draw us away such as materialism, expressive individualism and hedonism. May we be a church family who are joyful and godly witnesses as we aim to be transformed together and represent Jesus.
**- SRE:** Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus in our local public school. May we never take this for granted. Give our combined Christian teacher team (Lam, Carol, George, Fiona, Alice, Tracey, Glorya, Fiona, and Felishia) strength to keep teaching and witnessing faithfully. 
**- Mandarin Congregation:** Lord, we pray for the Gospel class after service that people will know Jesus. Not just intellectual knowledge, but reflecting their own life so that Jesus becomes their personal saviour. We pray for the Gospel class after Wednesday English class in June that students will hear the Gospel in their own language. Through the simple form of three word Gospel, and discussion questions, they will see that Gospel is relevant, and believable. We pray for the new Mandarin pastor that he and his congregation will have a smooth transition to our church.
