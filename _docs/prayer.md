## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** Lord God, the unfailing helper and guide of those whom you bring up in your steadfast fear and love, keep us, we pray, under the protection of your good providence, and give us a continual reverence and love for your holy name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Loving and compassionate Father, You are full of grace and kindness, patient and overflowing with love and faithfulness. Your holiness and fairness shine brightly, yet you never turn away from those who seek you. We find our safety and comfort in you, our God. Our lives are entrusted to your care, and we trust in your unfailing love. O faithful God, as we come before your throne of grace through Jesus, we humbly ask for your mercy and grace to meet our every need. May your Spirit work within us, producing in us the beautiful fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In the precious name of your beloved Son, we pray. Amen.
- **The Cross:** Father, Expand my heart, empower my speech, and give me words to proclaim your glory. At the cross, your grace removes my burdens, where justice and mercy meet in Christ's sacrifice. Christ endured anguish to bring me joy, was cast off to welcome me in, and suffered for my sins to grant me heaven's best. He wept to dry my tears, groaned to give me endless song, and bore pain for my eternal health. In his death, Christ conquered sin and death, and opened the way to eternal life. Help me to adore you with my words and actions, may every breath be praise, and every step filled with joy. As I see my enemies defeated and sin overcome by Christ's sacrifice, may I go forth in confidence, knowing that the cross is mighty to save. Amen.
- **Growing Up:** Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day.
- **Sermon:** Your word is true and powerful. It gives life and love and is also a double-edged sword that reveals sin and selfishness. It brings salvation and safety and also judgement and justice. We ignore it at our own peril. May we not be like Judah who kept rejecting it and suffered. May we be like Jeremiah who kept proclaiming despite persecution and rejection. May the world not reject Jesus (the word become flesh) and die. May people hear it as the aroma of Christ and live.

## Mission Partner Focus

- **Berkeley Life Centre:** Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain times and places so that they may find you. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast their burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. May people who are suffering from domestic violence, dealing with the police and justice system, suffering from mental illness, experiencing difficult and dysfunctional relationships and navigating health issues know that Jesus has come for all including sinners and to seek and save the lost. Please sustain Rev. Wayne Pickford and the team as they lead the church to be a light and witness in their community. We praise you for providing Samantha Trotter who is helping with the womens and children ministry. Pray for enough money to be raised to buy the building where the Op Shop is. May the Frozen Meals Ministry, BBQs and adopt a block be an avenue for the church to care for those struggling and hear the good news. May Glenn grow in his conviction, character and competence has he continues The Well Training Program. 

- **Empowering Everyone with English in Jesus’ Name:** We praise you for the many people groups that are in Hurstville including from Nepal, Thailand, Latin America, Mongolia and China. May we have a heart for them to settle and live well in Australia and more importantly to find their true residence in Jesus. May the teachers and volunteers be a model of love and good works as they teach people about Jesus and English.
