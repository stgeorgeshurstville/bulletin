## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.

- **Collect:** Lord God, without you we are not able to please you; mercifully grant that your Holy Spirit may in all things direct and rule our hearts; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

- **Growing Deep:** Oh Lord, how We love your law! Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path. Thank you that Jesus has give us the Word of Eternal Life. Thank you that heaven and earth may pass away but our Lord’s words will never pass away. Please help us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds by your Word. Please help us to deepen our understanding of and obedience to your Word. 


- **Church Sermon:** We thank you that although we were once far off from you and each other, you have brought us together in your Son and by His blood. We thank you that Jesus has broken down the dividing wall of hostility and created one new man in place of the two, so making peace, reconciling all people to you. Help us at St George’s to faithfully and fearless preach the Gospel of REconciliation, to those who are far off and to those who are near. Help us to commend the Gospel of peace through our love and service of one another. Please help us to selflessly and wisely use your gifts in the building of your Church, Amen. 


## Weekly Prayer Points
- **Conflict in the middle east** God of the nations,
whose kingdom rules over all,
have mercy on our broken and divided world.
In the land of our Saviour’s birth,
banish the spirit that makes for war.
Please give wisdom to those you have placed in authority,
Rescue the captives, shield those in danger, and bind up the broken hearted.
For those fighting for justice, may they be strengthened by your grace.
For those walking in darkness, may the light of your face shine upon them.
Above all, we pray that the peoples of Israel and the Middle East will find everlasting hope in you.
And in the land of your Son’s redeeming death and resurrection,
turn hearts to look to the Saviour and live.
Bring peace, Lord, while we wait for Christ's coming and rule,
When all people will beat their swords into plowshares,
When nation will not take up sword against nation,
And when every tear will be wiped away
by the Prince of Peace and Lord of Lords,
Amen

- **The Voice Referendum:** Gracious Lord, the Father from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, we pray for our nation. We lament the damage done to the original inhabitants of this land, since European settlement, including the loss of life, land and language. We recognise sins committed and harm done. We praise you that you have built your church among the First Peoples of this land and we rejoice to be brothers and sisters in Christ with them. Hear our prayer as together we consider the referendum on recognition and the Voice to Parliament. Preserve us in love, respect and mutual service. Give us a spirit of wisdom and discernment as we cast our votes. Father, whatever is decided, we beg you for clear and lasting progress in addressing inequality and closing the gap for First Nations peoples. Bless Australia, we pray, as the gospel is proclaimed, that we may be reconciled to you and to each other through him who died for all, Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour, in whose name we pray, Amen.
  
## Mission Partners
- **JC in SE Asia:** You call us to make and mature disciples of all nations. We ask that you’ll allow JC to courageously, lovingly and prayerfully share the gospel in a country where evangelism is not allowed and even publicly practicing one’s faith is difficult. May you soften the hearts of the authorities and the people so that they’ll hear and accept the peace, purpose and real spiritual prosperity in Jesus. May you raise up Christians and leaders in the university and church.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Government:** You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May they enact laws and initiatives so that the orphans, widows and harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit to their authority as we hold out the word of life and ultimately submit to you.
  
- **Children:**: Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow in their hearts a love and desire for Jesus and God’s Word. Give strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to genuinely love the kids.

- **Youth:** Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength and security in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness and at times feelings of hopelessness. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities and temptations. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness. May we be a church family who are joyful and godly witnesses as we aim to be transformed together and represent Jesus.

- **SRE:** Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus in our local public school. May we never take this for granted. Give our combined Christian teacher team (Lam, Carol, George, Alice, Tracey, Glorya, Fiona, and Andrew) strength to keep teaching and witnessing faithfully.
  
- **Mandarin Congregations:** Lord, we pray for the Gospel class after service that people will know Jesus. Not just intellectual knowledge, but reflecting their own life so that Jesus becomes their personal savior. We pray for the Gospel class after Wednesday English class in June that students will hear the Gospel in their own language. Through the simple form of three word Gospel, and discussion questions, they will see that Gospel is relevant, and believable. We pray for the new Mandarin pastor that he and his congregation will have a smooth transition to our church.
