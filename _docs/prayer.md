## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.

- **Collect:** Lord, we pray that your grace may always uphold and encourage us, and make us continually to be given to all good works; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

- **Our mission:** Our gracious Father, thank you for the privilege of calling us to join in your mission. Thank you that under you what we do makes a difference in the world. We pray therefore that you will save those around us and to transform them into the likeness of Jesus. Please use us to make disciples of the nations, love our neighbours. Please Father, glorify yourself, through our labour in your Son. We pray that we will not be consumers but contributors to the ministries that you have called us to. 

- **Church Sermon:** Dear God, We are sorry that we don’t love and serve one another, but we fight and compete against one another. Thank you that Jesus has come and saved us. Thank you that Jesus will put the world to the right side up. Help us to show what Jesus has done in the way we relate to one another especially as women and men. Please help our men to be more like Jesus in his self-denying service. Please help our women to be more like Jesus in his loving submission to His Father. In Jesus’ name, Amen. 


## Weekly Prayer Points
- **The Lord will raise the workers for children ministry at 4pm.**
- **Mid Autumn Festival.** We thank you that you created times and seasons and that we can celebrate the Mid Autumn Festival in Australia. Please help us to use this opportunity to invite our Mandarin-speaking non-Christian friends and family to come and hear the good news of Jesus. We pray that our church family may be welcoming of the new people who come and have your wisdom to know how to share Jesus with them.
- **The Voice Referendum:** Gracious Lord, the Father from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, we pray for our nation. We lament the damage done to the original inhabitants of this land, since European settlement, including the loss of life, land and language. We recognise sins committed and harm done. We praise you that you have built your church among the First Peoples of this land and we rejoice to be brothers and sisters in Christ with them. Hear our prayer as together we consider the referendum on recognition and the Voice to Parliament. Preserve us in love, respect and mutual service. Give us a spirit of wisdom and discernment as we cast our votes. Father, whatever is decided, we beg you for clear and lasting progress in addressing inequality and closing the gap for First Nations peoples. Bless Australia, we pray, as the gospel is proclaimed, that we may be reconciled to you and to each other through him who died for all, Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour, in whose name we pray, Amen.
- **Libya Floods:** May God sustain the energy, efforts, faith, and generosity of the church volunteer team and that His name may be glorified through their services. May emergency assistance reach those who need it and for the community to move towards recovery. May God’s comfort and peace be on all who have lost loved ones, suffered material losses, and are undergoing trauma and grief. In the midst of hardship and suffering, may God’s sovereign control and love may be evident, and that people will turn to Jesus for hope.
