**Prayer**

Stir up, Lord, the wills of your faithful people, that they may produce abundantly the fruit of good works, and receive your abundant reward; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

**Special Prayer Points**
- **Prayer from this week’s passage:** Dear God, in your kindness and generosity, you have given us everything. We have been deceived into thinking that there’s not enough, that you won’t provide, that we need to compete and hoard to be safe. We worry about many things. We hurt ourselves and others. Please forgive us. Thank you that you have created a world of abundance. Thank you that you are still graciously providing to us. Thank you that in Jesus we have the most important thing - to be your children. When we worry, remind us of your promises in Jesus. Help us to make your glory our greatest ambition and our Lord Jesus our greatest treasure. Amen. 
- **Mission week and Christmas events:** Think of someone who needs to know Jesus and pray for them.

**Church Ministries:** |

Cancare: Heavenly Father, we praise You for Your mercy and kindness. You understand what it means to face trials and suffering, and You sympathize with our weaknesses. We thank You for using CanCare to support cancer patients, both current and former, as well as their families and friends. Through Christ's love, they serve and walk alongside those navigating the challenging journey of cancer. Lord, we ask for Your continued guidance upon the CanCare team. Grant them wisdom, understanding, and unity of heart as they care for this community. May the peace of our Lord Jesus rest upon every cancer patient during this Christmas season, bringing comfort and hope.

 Evangelism Teams: Lord, we thank You for the abundant opportunities You have given us this Christmas season to serve You and proclaim Your gospel. We commit all the gatherings and activities in December into Your hands, asking for Your protection and guidance in every detail. May these arrangements glorify Your name and touch many hearts to receive Your love and salvation. We pray for the Mission Week from December 8 to 15 that You would inspire more brothers and sisters to participate eagerly. Let these events become opportunities to share the gospel, bless the community, and build each other up in faith. We also commit the Christmas Market on December 14 to You, asking that it serve as a bridge to connect with the community, introduce them to the church, and open doors for sharing the gospel. May this event also strengthen unity among the brothers and sisters as they serve together with one heart. We pray for the outdoor picnic service and church dinner on December 15 that these gatherings would display the unity of the church and become a testimony to Your glory. Lastly, we pray for the Mandarin Christmas carol service on December 24 and the Christmas Day services on December 25. Please prepare the hearts of all who attend, especially new friends, that they may hear the good news of the gospel, feel Your love and presence, and find eternal hope in Jesus Christ. 

 Nursing Home: We thank you Father, that our hope in Jesus cannot be taken from us. We remember those who are living in residential care, those who are living at home and receiving care, those who are providing the care, and their families. We pray for safety and comfort for the aged. We pray for protection for the carers, workers and volunteers from illness and other dangers. We pray that all will hear and experience the love and peace of Christ. During this Christmas season, may the peace and joy of our Lord Jesus fill every life. May they deeply sense Your presence and know that they are deeply loved by You.

**Groups in Church:** |

Cantonese Congregation: Lord, we pray for our brothers and sisters of the Cantonese congregation. As we step into December and approach the Christmas season, we thank You for Your guidance and grace throughout this year. May Your peace and joy fill the hearts of every brother and sister, helping us to deeply experience Your amazing love and presence as we prepare to celebrate the birth of our Savior. We pray that amidst the busyness of the season, we remain focused on You, keeping Christ at the center of our lives. May we bear witness to Your love not only within the church but also in our families, workplaces, and communities. Strengthen all those who serve, granting them unity and joy in their ministry, and let them experience Your comfort and encouragement as they labor for Your glory. Lord, we ask that You use our discipleship groups and Christmas gatherings as channels for spreading the gospel, drawing more people to know Jesus Christ. In a world that often values self-reliance and worldly achievements, help us live lives of faith and dependence on You, becoming living testimonies of Your truth and love, bringing glory to Your name. Amen.

Volunteers: Our Heavenly Father, we give thanks to you for Jesus, the Son of Man, who came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as ransom of many.  Jesus was the ultimate example of serving others. Father, please grant together all the volunteers at St. Georges may follow Jesus Christ, offering to you their gifts and talents they have received to serve others. Please strengthen and sustain them, that with patience and understanding they may love and care for your people, so that the body of Christ may be built up.  In Christ name we pray, Amen!
