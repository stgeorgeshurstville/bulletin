## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer**: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
  
- **Collect**: We beseech you, almighty God, look on the heartfelt desires of your servants, and stretch forth the right hand of your power to be our defence against all our enemies; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
  
- **Growing Out**:  Our gracious Father, thank you that the Gospel is the power of salvation to all people. Thank you that even now the just has the Gospel has come to us, it is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world. We pray that many in our generation will hear and truly understand you grace. Please help us to be godly in life, resilient in ministry, servant-hearted, Biblical in life, thought and ministry, and able to love and minister faithfully, compassionately and effectively in different and changing contexts, cooperating with one another, humble, wise, prayerful, reflective, energetic and effective. Please help us to take our faith in Jesus beyond the walls of the church into our workplace, school, where we live and where we holiday. Please help us to have a compassion for the lost like Jesus. Please help us to be willing to go into the world, to be interested in the lives of people we meet. Please give us opportunities to represent Jesus and to speak of Him. Please give us the words to say. Please save our neighbours through us.
  
- **Church Sermon**: Our Father in Heaven, You have provided and we are satisfied. We have clothes to wear and roofs over our heads. We have enough for today and the next. We have become proud and have forgotten you. We have foolishly said to our own hearts, ‘My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.’ And we have failed to love our neighbours as ourselves. We have worried, coveted and hoarded. We withheld from those who are in need. Thank you that you have saved us and freed us in Jesus. From our guilt. From the worries of this life and the deception of wealth. To the hope of your Kingdom, to love and generosity. Our Father, give us our daily bread. Amen.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Hurstville**: We pray that the 30,000 people in Hurstville, with many from different cultures and countries, will come to know Jesus as their Lord and Saviour. May we have a heart for the people you have placed around us. Please use us to represent Jesus and may your name be hallowed. May Chris Minns (NSW Premier and Legislative Assembly Member for Kogarah), Linda Burney (House Representative for Barton), David Coleman (House Representative for Banks) and Nick Katris (Mayor) know God as the one with ultimate authority and serve with love, justice and wisdom. 
- **Discipleship Groups**: May the seed of God’s word be planted and watered especially as the year begins and this ministry restarts. May we have clear direction, wisdom and discipline as we rebuild our discipleship ministry, have a secure attachment with Jesus and represent him. 
**Pastoral Care Team**: Father, you sent your Son to heal the brokenhearted. May we cast our burdens and anxieties upon you knowing that you can sympathise with our weaknesses and care for us. May the peace of God sustain us as we bear the hope of the gospel, point people to heaven and carry each other’s burdens. 
**People with Disabilities**: Thank you that all people are made in your image. We pray for those with disabilities that they would know their true value as your image-bearer. We pray that your love in Jesus will heal them of their experience and rejection and pain. We pray that they will know of Jesus’ sufficiency in their experience of chronic pain and suffering, that they will learn to form healthy relationships. We pray for forgiveness for the ways that we have often treated people with disabilities. Please help us to be like Jesus in welcoming those with disabilities into our church and lives. Please open our eyes to see them as whole human beings. Please help us to learn from those with disabilities as well as minister to them. We pray that by our love for one another, the world may see you. We look forward to the day when Jesus returns, when we will be given Resurrection bodies. Amen.
**Support Ministries**: Everlasting God, we give thanks for the many volunteers who have been faithfully serving in different ministries at church especially in this challenging period of time. Please strengthen and sustain them with patience and understanding that they may love and care for your people. Please grant that together they may follow and help others to follow Jesus Christ. May they offer their given gifts and talents to build up the church which is the body of Christ. We ask this for the communication, vestry, cleaning, flower, bulletin, meals, AV, sound, technology and other teams. May people come under the wings of your love and salvation. 
**New Life Nepalese Church**: We thank you for our Nepalese brothers and sisters who share our building. May they grow in their knowledge of your love for them and continue to speak the truth in love to their community. We pray that through their ministry, many more Nepalese would come to serve the Lord Jesus Christ. 
**Singles, Widows and Orphans**: We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
