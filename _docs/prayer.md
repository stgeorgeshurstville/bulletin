**Prayer**

Lord Jesus Christ, for our sake you fasted forty days and forty nights: give us grace to use such abstinence that, our flesh being subdued to the spirit, we may always obey your will in righteousness and true holiness, to your honour and glory; for you live and reign with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God, for evermore. Amen.

**Mission Partners**

**1. Mathys and PNG**
- General info: There are >800 languages spoken in Papua New Guinea, but only 13 have complete bibles. Calvin and Ruth work alongside Papua New Guineans in roles that support the ongoing ministry of bible translation. Calvin is an aircraft maintenance engineer, in order to provide transport and logistics support for bible translators. Ruth provides training for the bible translators, so that locals can take the lead in this work. 
- Mathys family have returned to Australia for home assignment and will stay here until July. They have a very busy schedule filled with medical appointments, opportunities to upskill, as well as share their insights/wisdom from serving cross-culturally 
Give thanks that they can enjoy their first family holiday in over 5 years, and share to family, friends, churches and supporters about what God is doing in Papua New Guinea (they will be visiting us in May)
Give thanks for Jakob (oldest son) who has now started studying video game programming at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment


**Church Ministries**

**Discipleship groups**
Please pray for all the discipleship groups that started meeting again last week. Pray that our members won't give up meeting together, but will encourage others in their group, just as Christ has drawn them to himself.


**Groups in Church**

**1. Nepalese church**
- Our weekly bible study resumed last month. Each week we normally gather 7 to 10 people in our bible study. 
- Please pray that this group will grow in their understanding of God’s word and become mature disciples of Jesus. 
- Please pray to those people who heard the gospel through our fellowship here, when they go back to Nepal to find the right church. 
- Please pray for Nepalese students to balance their life, often they work long hours while studying.

**Special Items & Events**

**1. From the passage:**
From the passage:
Heavenly Father,
We come before You weary and burdened, longing for the rest that only You can give. We praise You, Lord of heaven and earth, for revealing Your truth not to the wise and learned, but to little children—to those who come humbly, dependent, and trusting in Your grace.

Thank You for Jesus, who calls us to Himself, who lifts the unbearable burdens we place upon ourselves, and who replaces them with His gentle and light yoke. Teach us to rest not in our own efforts, achievements, or religious performance, but in the gift of grace You have freely given through Your Son.

Forgive us, Lord, when we strive to earn what You have already promised. When we turn rest into another task, when we impose impossible burdens on ourselves and others, when we fail to trust in the sufficiency of Your love—renew our hearts and lead us back to Jesus, who is our peace.

By Your Holy Spirit, empower us to live in the freedom of Your rest. Strengthen us when we are weak, guide us when we are lost, and fill us with the peace that surpasses understanding. May Your Spirit shape our hearts, giving us the desire and ability to walk in the way of Christ, yoked to Him, doing the good works You have prepared for us—not out of striving, but from the joy of being Yours.

For those among us who are exhausted—whether from sorrow, labour, or striving—may they hear the voice of Jesus calling, “Come to me, and I will give you rest.” May our refreshment be found in Him, our renewal in the grace of His Gospel, and joy in the power of the Holy Spirit.

In the name of the one who is greater than the Temple and the Lord of the Sabbath,
Amen.
