| **From the Passage** | Heavenly Father, we thank You that the Spirit of the Sovereign Lord rests upon the Anointed One, Jesus Christ, who has come to proclaim the ultimate Year of Jubilee. We confess that we often live like captives to our own discontent, trapped in a cycle of feeling that we are never enough and have never "arrived." We thank You that just as the ancient ruins were rebuilt, You are in the business of restoring our fractured identities. Lord, bind up our brokenheartedness and release us from the "eternal debts" of sin and shame that we could never pay on our own. <br><br>We marvel at the Great Exchange of the Gospel: that You take our heavy ashes and bestow a crown of beauty; You take our spirit of despair and wrap us in a garment of praise. Thank You for stopping the hand of vengeance to offer us a season of radical grace. Help us to trade our self-centeredness for Your righteousness, wearing the "wedding clothes" You have provided with humility and joy. May we live today as a garden of Your glory, secure in the double portion of Your blessing and the faithfulness of Your everlasting covenant. Amen. <br><br> **Amen.** |

| **Mission Partners** | **JC in SE Asia**<br><br>General info: JC is ministering in a secure location. Our support allows him to be in the country and share the gospel.<br><br>Heavenly Father,
We come before You today to lift up James and the vital work You have called him to do in South East Asia. We thank You for his heart to see the Gospel not just heard, but deeply rooted and multiplied through the lives of others.
Lord, we ask you to bless him as he leads various Bible studies. As he shows people how to handle the truth correctly, let the light of Your Word transform their minds. May they move beyond surface-level reading to a deep, theological understanding that empowers their service.
We specifically pray for the 1-to-1 ministry with the brothers who serve as small group leaders that he is training. Though they are busy with secular occupations, we ask that their time with James would be a renewing for their soul—a place of rapid growth and refreshment.
We pray for his long term plans to help trainees to become trainers. Break down any barriers of fear or inadequacy, and help them to start training others, even in the smallest ways.
Lastly, we pray for the church leaders at the local church he serves at. Soften their hearts to see the beauty of people that have been asked to serve. Help them to see that the time spent equipping the saints is a worthy, biblical, and essential investment for the long-term health of Your Kingdom.
Protect James, fill him with Your Spirit, and let him see the fruit of his labor in due season.
<br><br>In Jesus' name, Amen.|
