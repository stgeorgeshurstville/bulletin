## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
  
- **Collect:** Almighty and everlasting God, you are always more ready to hear than we to pray, and constantly give more than either we desire or deserve: pour down on us the abundance of your mercy, forgiving us those things of which our conscience is afraid, and giving us those good things which we are not worthy to ask, except through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ, your Son our Lord. Amen.
- **Growing Out:** Our gracious Father, thank you that the Gospel is the power of salvation to all people. Thank you that even now the just has the Gospel has come to us, it is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world. We pray that many in our generation will hear and truly understand you grace. Please help us to be godly in life, resilient in ministry, servant-hearted, Biblical in life, thought and ministry, and able to love and minister faithfully, compassionately and effectively in different and changing contexts, cooperating with one another, humble, wise, prayerful, reflective, energetic and effective. Please help us to take our faith in Jesus beyond the walls of the church into our workplace, school, where we live and where we holiday. Please help us to have a compassion for the lost like Jesus. Please help us to be willing to go into the world, to be interested in the lives of people we meet. Please give us opportunities to represent Jesus and to speak of Him. Please give us the words to say. Please save our neighbours through us.
- **Church Sermon:** We thank you for purchasing us with the precious blood of your pure and perfect Son. We are sorry for when we are sinful, selfish and don’t live according to who we are in Jesus. We are sorry for hurting you and others when we do this. Help us to be godly and do good to others in every situation. Help us to love God and God’s Temple whether we are unmarried, married, free, under slavery, circumcised or uncircumcised. May we know that we are slaves who are free.

- **Local High School Scripture with Aywan:** Loving Father, we thank you that you want all people to come to a saving knowledge of you. We ask that the high schoolers in our area (especially at Hurstville Boys, Sydney Tech and Oatley High) will see Jesus as the way, the truth and the life. We praise you for the partners who have been praying for and giving to the ministry. May you help students to find their identity and security in Jesus particularly when things get busy, life doesn’t work out as planned and things may seem confusing and meaningless. We pray that Aywan Suleiman will passionately and faithfully teach and model the gospel of love to the students and the people around him. We praise you for allowing a group at Oatley to start up. We ask that you’ll grow the number of students who get to hear about Jesus including the Year 7 group at Hurstville Boys. May all find their wisdom in Jesus.

Please help the locals to cope with the rising cost of living and uncertainties in the future. May you bring a stop to the tribal violence and help them know the peace of God.

## Regular Prayer Points

**Hurstville:** We pray that the 30,000 people in Hurstville, with many from different cultures and countries, will come to know Jesus as their Lord and Saviour. May we have a heart for the people you have placed around us. May we be lights in our neighbourhood which is in darkness and filled with anxiety and uncertainty. May we be mindful of the changing demographics and seek to share the gospel with them whether it’s to the Nepalese, Indians, Indonesians, Koreans etc. May Chris Minns (NSW Premier), Linda Burney (House Representative for Barton), David Coleman (House Representative for Banks) and Nick Katris (Mayor) know God as the one with ultimate authority and serve with love, justice and wisdom. 
**Discipleship Groups:** May you help us to plant and water well as we rely on and proclaim the foolish message of the cross. Please give the growth so that we’ll all reach unity and maturity in the faith. May we have clear direction, wisdom and discipline as we seek to represent Jesus and grow up, deep and out. 
**Pastoral Care Team:** Father, we pray for people recently lost their loved family members that you comfort them. Help them to grieve with hope in Christ. For those who passed have your grace of salvation and are now secured in your glory. We pray for the couples in church that they have strong marriage and faith in God. Lord, help Rev. Tim and Wendy that they get to know the 4pm congregation and will be helpful to people in need.
**People with Disabilities:** Thank you that all people are made in your image. We pray for those with disabilities that they would know their true value as your image-bearer. We pray that your love in Jesus will heal them of their experience and rejection and pain. We pray that they will know of Jesus’ sufficiency in their experience of chronic pain and suffering, that they will learn to form healthy relationships. We pray for forgiveness for the ways that we have often treated people with disabilities. Please help us to be like Jesus in welcoming those with disabilities into our church and lives. Please open our eyes to see them as whole human beings. Please help us to learn from those with disabilities as well as minister to them. We pray that by our love for one another, the world may see you. We look forward to the day when Jesus returns, when we will be given Resurrection bodies. Amen.
**Support Ministries:** Everlasting God, we give thanks for the many volunteers who have been faithfully serving in different ministries at church. Please strengthen and sustain them with patience and understanding that they may love and care for your people. Please grant that together they may follow and help others to follow Jesus Christ. May they offer their God’s  given gifts and talents to build up the church which is the body of Christ. We ask this for the communication, vestry, cleaning, flower, bulletin, meals, AV, sound, technology and other teams. 
**New Life Nepalese Church:** We thank you for our Nepalese brothers and sisters who share our building. May they grow in their knowledge of your love for them and continue to speak the truth in love to their community. We pray that through their ministry many more Nepalese would come to serve the Lord Jesus Christ. Please give us a heart for these people especially as more people from this demographic come and live in and around Hurstville.  
**Singles, Widows and Orphans:** We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
