## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** God our Father, you have prepared for those who love you such good things as pass man’s understanding: pour into our hearts such love towards you, that we, loving you above all things, may obtain your promises which exceed all that we can desire; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Dear God, our loving and kind Father, you are full of grace and patience, and you always love us. You are holy and fair, but you never turn away from those who look for you. We feel safe and comforted with you, our God. We trust you with our lives and know your love never fails. As we come to you through Jesus, we ask for your mercy and help with everything we need. Let your Spirit work in us to grow love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
- **Mission:** Dear God, our loving Father, thank you for letting us be part of your plan. Thank you for letting us make a difference in the world. We ask that you help the people around us to know Jesus and become more like him. Please use us to teach others about you and to love our neighbors. Help us to do things that honor you, and not just take, but give and help in the ways you want us to.

## Mission Partner Focus

- **Mission Partner Focus (June):** Each month, we’ve been focusing on a mission partner and their ministry. This year, we’ve focused on our Nepali ministry, Compassion and JC. Our focus for this month is Mellisa Wang. She is seeking to make disciples at the University of Adelaide.
  - Prayer: We praise you for the people from different nations coming to Adelaide University. May they not only settle well but more importantly find their citizenship in heaven. We praise you for giving Mellisa the desire and means to share the gospel with others. May the 6 females she is reading the Bible with keep being a source of encouragement and a way to grow each other in maturity. May the upcoming Mid Year Conference help people to understand their union with Christ more. We thank you that students have heard about and some have trusted in Jesus. We praise you for helping Ricardo to realise that salvation is a gift. We praise you for his desire to invite others to know Jesus and the opportunity he is having to read the Bible with a Hindu. We praise you for people like Mel who wants to grow in Christ. Please keep sustaining Mellisa in godliness, strength and wisdom as she keeps sharing the good news. Help her to keep realising that a Christian is about who we are in Jesus rather than what we do for him.
  - Next Steps: You can sign up for Mellisa’s newsletter to be updated and find out about other ways you can partner with her. Please speak to someone from the mission subcommittee if you have any questions.
- **Moore College:** We thank you for providing stewards to equip your saints for the work of ministry. Praise God for using Moore Theological College to encourage Christians to be more like Jesus and share about Him in Sydney and the world. Pray that God will keep the board, faculty and students godly, prayerful and other people centred (more information [here](https://moore.edu.au/missions).

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Volunteers:** Everlasting God, we give thanks for the many volunteers who have been faithfully serving in different ministries at church especially in this challenging period of time. Please strengthen and sustain them with patience and understanding that they may love and care for your people. Please grant that together they may follow Jesus Christ, offer you their given gifts and talents, and build up the church, the body of Christ.
- **Hurstville**: We pray that the 30,000 people in Hurstville, with many from different cultures and countries, will come to know Jesus as their Lord and Saviour. May we have a heart for the people you have placed around us. May we be lights in our neighbourhood which is in darkness and filled with anxiety and uncertainty. May we be mindful of the changing demographics and seek to share the gospel with them. We commit to you the Nepali community and ask that many will come to know Christ through the ministry of Bijaya and our church. May Chris Minns (NSW Premier and Legislative Assembly Member for Kogarah), Linda Burney (House Representative for Barton), David Coleman (House Representative for Banks) and Nick Katris (Mayor) know God as the one with ultimate authority and serve and lead with love, justice and wisdom. 
- **Discipleship Groups**: We praise you for the opportunity to spur each other to love and good deeds. May the seed of God’s word grow as we plant and water. May we know who Jesus is as we grow in our secure attachment with him. Help us to be vulnerable, repentant and Christ like as we inwardly digest, delight in and do his word. 
- **Pastoral Care Team**: Father, you sent your Son to heal the brokenhearted. May we cast our burdens and anxieties upon you knowing that you can sympathise with our weaknesses and care for us. May the peace of God sustain us as we bear the hope of the gospel, point people to heaven and carry each other’s burdens. 
- **People with Disabilities**: Thank you that all people are made in your image. We pray for those with disabilities that they would know their true value as your image-bearers. May your love in Jesus heal them from any experience of rejection and pain. We pray that they will know of Jesus’ sufficiency in their experience of chronic pain and suffering. Forgive us for the ways we have often treated people with disabilities. Please help us to be like Jesus in welcoming all people and going out to love, seek and save the lost. Please open our eyes to see them as whole human beings and the seemingly weaker parts of the body are indispensable. Please help us to learn and listen from those with disabilities and their carers. May the world see Jesus through our love for one another. We look forward to the day when Jesus returns and his people will be given sinless resurrection bodies. Amen.
- **Support Ministries**: Everlasting God, we give thanks for the many volunteers who have been faithfully serving in different ministries at church both up front and behind the scenes. Please strengthen and sustain them with patience, understanding and joy to love and care. May you use their gifts and talents to build up the church which is the body of Christ. We ask this for the communication, cleaning, flower, bulletin, meals, AV, sound, music, bible readin, maintenance, prayer, set up, pack up, welcoming, technology and other teams. May people come to know Jesus as the Son of Man who came to serve and not to be served through our words and actions. May we all see that we have been given the manifestation of the Spirit to build up one another.
