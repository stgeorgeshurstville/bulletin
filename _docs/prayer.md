## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer**: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.

- **Collect**: Almighty God, give us grace that we may cast away the works of darkness and put on the armour of light, now in the time of this mortal life in which your Son Jesus Christ came among us in great humility; that on the last day, when he comes again in his glorious majesty to judge the living and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through him who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever. Amen.

- **Growing Deep**: Oh Lord, how We love your law! Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path. Thank you that Jesus has give us the Word of Eternal Life. Thank you that heaven and earth may pass away but our Lord’s words will never pass away. Please help us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds by your Word. Please help us to deepen our understanding of and obedience to your Word.

## Weekly Prayer Points
- **Diwali (12 Nov)**: As people celebrate the Hindu festival of lights which symbolises the victory of light over darkness, may they come to understand and place their trust in Jesus who triumphed over all rulers and authorities by his death and resurrection. 

- **Conflict in the Middle East**: God of the nations, whose kingdom rules over all, have mercy on our broken and divided world. In the land of our Saviour’s birth, banish the spirit that makes for war. Please give wisdom to those you have placed in authority, rescue the captives, shield those in danger, and bind up the broken hearted. For those fighting for justice, may they be strengthened by your grace. For those walking in darkness, may the light of your face shine upon them. Above all, we pray that the people of Israel and the Middle East will find everlasting hope in you. And in the land of your Son’s redeeming death and resurrection, turn hearts to look to the Saviour and live. Bring peace, Lord, while we wait for Christ's coming and rule, when all people will beat their swords into plowshares, when nation will not take up sword against nation, and when every tear will be wiped away by the Prince of Peace and Lord of Lords, Amen

- **Indigenous Australians**: Holy Father, God of Love, You are the Creator of this land and of all good things. Our hope is in you because you gave your Son Jesus to reconcile the world to you. We pray for your strength and grace to forgive, accept and love one another, as you love us and forgive and accept us in the sacrifice of your Son. Give us the courage to accept the realities of our history so that we may build a better future for our nation. Teach us to respect all cultures. Teach us to care for our land and waters. Help us to share justly the resources of this land. Help us to bring about spiritual and social change to improve the quality of life for all groups in our communities, especially the disadvantaged. Help young people to find true dignity and self esteem by your Spirit. May your power and love be the foundations on which we build our families, our communities and our nation, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Please allow believers to live quiet, peaceful and godly lives so more people will come to the truth. May you raise up Christians and leaders in the university and church.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Government**: You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May they enact laws and initiatives so that the orphans, widows and harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit to their authority as we hold out the word of life and ultimately submit to you. 

- **Children**: Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow in their hearts a love and desire for Jesus and God’s Word. Give strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to genuinely love the kids. 

- **Youth**: Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength and security in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness and hopelessness. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities and temptations. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness. May we be a church family who are joyful and godly witnesses as we aim to have Jesus at the centre of our lives. May youths keep growing through the various stages of life including those finishing primary and secondary school. May our combined youth evangelistic event on the 1st of December be a night where many find their true purpose in Jesus.  

- **SRE**: Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus in our local public school. May we never take this for granted. Give our combined Christian teacher team (Lam, Carol, George, Alice, Tracey, Glorya, Fiona, and Andrew) strength to keep teaching and witnessing faithfully. 

- **Mandarin Congregation**: Lord, we pray for the Gospel class after service that people will know Jesus. Not just intellectual knowledge, but reflecting their own life so that Jesus becomes their personal savior. We pray for the Gospel class after Wednesday English class in June that students will hear the Gospel in their own language. Through the simple form of three word Gospel, and discussion questions, they will see that Gospel is relevant, and believable. We pray for the new Mandarin pastor that he and his congregation will have a smooth transition to our church.
