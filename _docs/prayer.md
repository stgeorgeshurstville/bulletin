## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.

- **Collect:** Stir up, Lord, the wills of your faithful people, that they may produce abundantly the fruit of good works, and receive your abundant reward; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

- **Growing Up:** Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day. 

- **Church Sermon**: Father, we thank you being faithful to your promises in Jesus. May we proclaim as Paul did, “​​For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.” 




## Weekly Prayer Points
- **Baptism**: We praise you for the baptism of our brothers and sisters and that through the death and resurrection of your Son you’ve brought them from death to life. Enable them by your Spirit to resist the power of sin and give themselves to you as a living sacrifice. May they not be conformed to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of their mind, so that they may serve and please you in every way.
  
- **Conflict in the middle east**: God of the nations, whose kingdom rules over all, have mercy on our broken and divided world. In the land of our Saviour’s birth, banish the spirit that makes for war. Please give wisdom to those you have placed in authority, rescue the captives, shield those in danger, and bind up the broken hearted. For those fighting for justice, may they be strengthened by your grace. For those walking in darkness, may the light of your face shine upon them. Above all, we pray that the people of Israel and the Middle East will find everlasting hope in you. And in the land of your Son’s redeeming death and resurrection, turn hearts to look to the Saviour and live. Bring peace, Lord, while we wait for Christ's coming and rule, when all people will beat their swords into plowshares, when nation will not take up sword against nation, and when every tear will be wiped away by the Prince of Peace and Lord of Lords, Amen

- **St Andrew’s Cathedral School**: God of all mercy, giver of all comfort: when we cannot understand the things that happen, and are weighed down by loss and loneliness, uphold us in your love. Look graciously, we pray, on those in grief, pain, and confusion, especially the victim's family, whose loss is so keen, together with the whole St Andrew’s Cathedral and Danebank Anglican School community: for students, teachers, other staff, alumni, and also their families. We pray specifically for Head of Schools, Dr Julie McGonigle and Dr Emma Burgess, for her Executive team and for the school Chaplains, called to lead the School community through this time of trouble: grant them depths of wisdom, compassion and resilience. We pray also for students with final HSC and IB exams coping with this additional stress. Casting all their cares on you, may each member of the School community know the consolation of your love. Give us all the assurance of your constant care, that we may have courage for the days ahead. We pray in the name of our Friend and Saviour, the only one to promise to wipe every tear from our eyes, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen

- **Indigenous Australians:** Holy Father, God of Love, You are the Creator of this land and of all good things. Our hope is in you because you gave your Son Jesus to reconcile the world to you. We pray for your strength and grace to forgive, accept and love one another, as you love us and forgive and accept us in the sacrifice of your Son. Give us the courage to accept the realities of our history so that we may build a better future for our nation. Teach us to respect all cultures. Teach us to care for our land and waters. Help us to share justly the resources of this land. Help us to bring about spiritual and social change to improve the quality of life for all groups in our communities, especially the disadvantaged. Help young people to find true dignity and self esteem by your Spirit. May your power and love be the foundations on which we build our families, our communities and our nation, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. May people who are suffering from domestic violence, dealing with the police and justice system, suffering from mental illness, experiencing difficult and dysfunctional relationships and navigating health issues will know that Jesus has come for the sinners and to seek and save the lost.

- **CanCare**: Father God, we thank you that you know what it means to face trials and pain and that you can sympathise with our weaknesses. We thank you that you use CanCare to support people and their family and friends who are or have suffered from the ravages of cancer. May God bless those suffering from cancer with His peace. May God's salvation come to those who have yet to accept Jesus. As Christmas is appoarching, we also ask for your protection to the Cancare volunteers who will be away for holiday or visiting their family and friends overseas during this festive season. We pray for those who remain in Sydney to eagerly work with one another and faithfully serve the patients and their carers.

- **Evangelism Teams and Programs**: Gracious Lord, our neighbours are lost and far away from you. We long for the opportunity to proclaim your name. Please give us the eyes to see those whom you have placed before us. Whenever I open my mouth, may words be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel. We pray that as the seeds of the gospel are scattered and planted, that they would land on good soil. Please make them bear fruit, Father. Scare away the crows. Crush the rocks. Strangle the weeds. Instead, give us rich healthy soil ready to receive the seeds of the gospel. In Jesus’ name, we pray.

Use their testimony so that their family and friends would be encouraged and the non-believers will be attracted to the Gospel of Jesus. We pray for the preparation of Christmas market that church people will be passionately outreaching to the community through selling second hand items or food. Pray that this will be a day to witness God’s love is active amongst us. Amen.
