## Qwwk 3 (Third Sunday of the month)

### From the passage ###
From Matthew 13:
Heavenly Father,
We praise You for Your kingdom, hidden from the proud but revealed to those who come in humility. Thank You for sending Jesus, who spoke in parables—not to confuse, but to separate true disciples from the crowd. Give us ears to hear and hearts that truly understand.

Father, we confess how easily we can be distracted—by worries, wealth, or our own independence. Break our pride, that we may come to Jesus not as those who think we see, but as the blind who long for sight. Make us like the good soil, receiving Your Word with faith and bearing fruit that glorifies You.
Lord Jesus, You alone open the way to the kingdom. Thank You that there is no test to pass, no achievement required—only the call to come. Help us to trust in You fully, to treasure Your kingdom above all else, and to shine Your light in the world.

You have taught us that a day of judgment is coming, when the wheat will be gathered, and the weeds will be burned. Help us not to be complacent but to take Your warning seriously. Keep us watchful and faithful, ready for Your return, and living each day as true disciples who treasure Your kingdom above all else.
In Your mercy, draw many to repentance before that day comes. May many be found in You, shining like the righteous in our Father's kingdom.

In the  name of the one who will come again to gather the harvest,
Amen.
