## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.

- **Collect:** Keep your Church, Lord God, with your continual mercy, and because the frailty of man without you cannot but fall, keep us always under your protection, and lead us to everything that makes for our salvation; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

- **Growing Deep:** Oh Lord, how We love your law! Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path. Thank you that Jesus has give us the Word of Eternal Life. Thank you that heaven and earth may pass away but our Lord’s words will never pass away. Please help us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds by your Word. Please help us to deepen our understanding of and obedience to your Word. 

- **Church Sermon:** Gracious Lord, We praise you for making all people in your image, and that not one hair falls to the ground without you knowing. Thank you that you provide for all people through work. Forgive us for our greed, for when we fail to pay what is owed, for when we enrich ourselves at others’ expense. Please help us to act justly with the resources you have entrusted us with. We live in a world that is enslaving itself in the pursuit of freedom. We thank you that you have saved us from this enslavement  - through the lordship of your Son, who though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor, so that we through his poverty might become rich. Help us know how we might be hindering others from salvation and growth. Help us to follow Paul’s example as he follows the example of Jesus, that many will come to experience  the immeasurable joy of knowing Jesus. Amen.  

## Weekly Prayer Points
- **The Lord will raise the workers for children ministry at 4pm.**
- **Mid Autumn Festival.** We thank you that you created times and seasons and that we can celebrate the Mid Autumn Festival in Australia. Please help us to use this opportunity to invite our Mandarin-speaking non-Christian friends and family to come and hear the good news of Jesus. We pray that our church family may be welcoming of the new people who come and have your wisdom to know how to share Jesus with them.
- **The Voice Referendum:** Gracious Lord, the Father from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, we pray for our nation. We lament the damage done to the original inhabitants of this land, since European settlement, including the loss of life, land and language. We recognise sins committed and harm done. We praise you that you have built your church among the First Peoples of this land and we rejoice to be brothers and sisters in Christ with them. Hear our prayer as together we consider the referendum on recognition and the Voice to Parliament. Preserve us in love, respect and mutual service. Give us a spirit of wisdom and discernment as we cast our votes. Father, whatever is decided, we beg you for clear and lasting progress in addressing inequality and closing the gap for First Nations peoples. Bless Australia, we pray, as the gospel is proclaimed, that we may be reconciled to you and to each other through him who died for all, Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour, in whose name we pray, Amen.

## Mission Partners
- **JC in SE Asia:** You call us to make and mature disciples of all nations. We ask that you’ll allow JC to courageously, lovingly and prayerfully share the gospel in a country where evangelism is not allowed and even publicly practicing one’s faith is difficult. May you soften the hearts of the authorities and the people so that they’ll hear and accept the peace, purpose and real spiritual prosperity in Jesus. Please give safety to your people as the authorities restrict religious activities. Please allow them to be a godly witness. May you raise up Christians and leaders in the university and church.

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Government:** You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May they enact laws and initiatives so that the orphans, widows and harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit to their authority as we hold out the word of life and ultimately submit to you. 

- **Children:** Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow in their hearts a love and desire for Jesus and God’s Word. Give strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to genuinely love the kids. 

- **Youth:** Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength and security in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness and at times feelings of hopelessness. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities and temptations. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness. May we be a church family who are joyful and godly witnesses as we aim to be transformed together and represent Jesus. Please help the Y12 students finish high school well and keep growing in Christ. 
SRE: Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus in our local public school. May we never take this for granted. Give our combined Christian teacher team (Lam, Carol, George, Alice, Tracey, Glorya, Fiona, and Andrew) strength to keep teaching and witnessing faithfully. 

- **Mandarin Congregation:** Lord, we praise you for a couple of ladies who have committed their lives to Christ through our Gospel Class. We pray that as they received Christ Jesus as Lord, they may continue to live their lives in him, rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness (Colossians 2:6-7). We praise you for a number of non-Christians who have joined our Gospel Classes of both Mandarin congregations. We pray that the good news of the Lord Jesus may be proclaimed clearly and faithfully to them and that in your mercy you may save them.
