## Week E


| **From the Passage** | Gracious Father, <br><br> We thank you for the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ—your power to save, to reconcile, to make new. We praise you that in Jesus’ death and resurrection, you have given us a sure hope and a clear call to live no longer for ourselves, but for him who loved us and gave himself for us. Lord, we see the breadth and depth of gospel application, how it speaks to every part of life: our fears, motives, relationships, even our methods of ministry. Nothing that matters to us is untouched by the gospel. Forgive us when we live as if it were narrow or small. Train us to apply it to ourselves with honesty, and to others with love. Father, we pray for those who are still your enemies—those who do not yet know Christ, those who reject him, those who ignore him. Have mercy, Lord. Break through their hardness of heart. We beg you: give us opportunities to tell them of Jesus, to plead with them as Paul did, to hold out the message of reconciliation and the love of Christ. And Father, begin with us. Break our hearts of stone, and replace them with hearts of flesh. Move us. Control us. Compel us with the love of Christ, so that we love like Jesus—patient, persistent, sacrificial. Free us from fear of people, and teach us to fear you instead. Use us, Lord, as your ambassadors. Make your appeal through us, that many might be reconciled to you. We ask this in the name of Jesus, our risen Lord and Judge, our Saviour and Friend. Amen.

<br><br> | **Church Ministries** | <br><br> *Evangelism teams*:
Gracious Lord, we thank You for entrusting us with the privilege of sharing the Gospel with those who are lost and searching. Please give us spiritual eyes to see the people You bring into our lives, and hearts that are ready to speak of Christ with clarity, love, and boldness. We lift up to You the Kids Holiday Hub on October 13. We thank You for this opportunity to connect with children and families from our community. May every interaction be filled with Your grace and purpose. We pray that many will be drawn to know more about Jesus through this event. Unite and strengthen our evangelism team. Fill us with Your Spirit, so that both our words and our lives reflect the love, truth, and hope of Jesus. Help us to trust in Your power to work through us and to be faithful in sowing seeds for Your kingdom.

Heavenly Father, we thank You for leading our Cantonese congregation. You have called us to follow Jesus as His disciples, reflect His glory, and shine His light in a dark world. Help us not to live by sight, but by faith—looking to what is eternal and unseen. May our lives be ignited by the love of Christ, shaped by His grace, and lived out in service for Your glory and the good of others. Make us faithful ambassadors of the Gospel. Help us to see the souls redeemed by Your blood, and to carry out the mission You’ve entrusted to us, not in our own strength, but through the power of the Spirit. Unite and strengthen our ministry teams. In every challenge, teach us to rely on You and reflect Christ in all we do. May our church be a witness of hope, love, and new life in Jesus.
