## Sunday Prayer Points


  
- **Collect**: Almighty God, grant that we, who justly deserve to be punished for our sinful deeds, may in your mercy and kindness be pardoned and restored; through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.
  
- **Growing Up**: Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day. 
- **Church Sermon:** Our Father in heaven, we praise you for the debt that has been paid by Jesus on the Cross. May we be truthful, honest and vulnerable before God and others about the sins we’ve committed and also with the hurt we’ve experienced because of the sin of others. May we ask for forgiveness where appropriate and offer forgiveness where needed. When we find this hard, help us to focus on the grace, mercy and love of God. May this overflow to others. As this happens, may the world know that we are your disciples. Amen.

- **Evangelism Teams and Programs:** Gracious Lord, our neighbours are lost and far away from you. We long for the opportunity to proclaim your name. Please give us the eyes to see those whom you have placed before us. Whenever I open my mouth, may words be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel. We pray that as the seeds of the gospel are scattered and planted, that they would land on good soil. Please make them bear fruit, Father. Scare away the crows. Crush the rocks. Strangle the weeds. Instead, give us rich healthy soil ready to receive the seeds of the gospel. In Jesus’ name, we pray.
