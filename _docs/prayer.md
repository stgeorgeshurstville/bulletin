| **From the Passage** | Gracious Father, <br><br> We thank you for the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ—your power to save, to reconcile, to make new. We praise you that in Jesus’ death and resurrection, you have given us a sure hope and a clear call to live no longer for ourselves, but for him who loved us and gave himself for us. Lord, we see the breadth and depth of gospel application, how it speaks to every part of life: our fears, motives, relationships, even our methods of ministry. Nothing that matters to us is untouched by the gospel. Forgive us when we live as if it were narrow or small. Train us to apply it to ourselves with honesty, and to others with love. Father, we pray for those who are still your enemies—those who do not yet know Christ, those who reject him, those who ignore him. Have mercy, Lord. Break through their hardness of heart. We beg you: give us opportunities to tell them of Jesus, to plead with them as Paul did, to hold out the message of reconciliation and the love of Christ. And Father, begin with us. Break our hearts of stone, and replace them with hearts of flesh. Move us. Control us. Compel us with the love of Christ, so that we love like Jesus—patient, persistent, sacrificial. Free us from fear of people, and teach us to fear you instead. Use us, Lord, as your ambassadors. Make your appeal through us, that many might be reconciled to you. We ask this in the name of Jesus, our risen Lord and Judge, our Saviour and Friend. Amen. |
