## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** Lord God, you declare your almighty power chiefly in showing mercy and pity: grant us such a measure of your grace that, running in the way of your commandments, we may obtain your promises, and share in your heavenly treasure; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Dear God, our loving and kind Father, you are full of grace and patience, and you always love us. You are holy and fair, but you never turn away from those who look for you. We feel safe and comforted with you, our God. We trust you with our lives and know your love never fails. As we come to you through Jesus, we ask for your mercy and help with everything we need. Let your Spirit work in us to grow love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
- **Our Purpose:** Sovereign Creator, My greatest concern is to fulfill the purpose for which you have given me: to glorify you and to do good to others. Life holds no value if it is not dedicated to this noble cause. Sadly, many live solely for themselves, pursuing wealth, status and pleasure as if these could bring lasting happiness. But these are false and empty pursuits which only lead to misery. True happiness lies in loving you and striving for holiness. May I never be swayed by the fleeting pleasures and vanities of this world. Help me to see through the illusions of worldly success and pleasure, recognizing that true fulfillment can only be found in a life devoted to your Son. Grant me the grace to remain faithful to you, rejecting sinful pleasures and seeking only your will. Let me always remember that my ultimate happiness and purpose can only be realized in a life lived for you.
- **Growing Up:** Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day.
- **Sermon:** We are fighting against our flesh, the world and the devil. We are tempted to leave Jesus for selfish pursuits, sensuality and seductive teachings. May you help us to focus on who Jesus is. May we grow in our knowledge that Jesus is God where he is the image of the invisible Father, the creator where all things are created in and through him and the saviour where all things are reconciled through his blood. We praise you for making believers holy, blameless and above reproach. May we know that Jesus has supremacy over everything including the old creation, new creation and of course our very lives. May we know that everything was created for Jesus. May we continue to have faith in this Jesus.

## Mission Related Prayer Points
- **Berkeley Life Centre:** Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain times and places so that they may find you. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast their burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background, rely on public housing, face domestic violence and face all kinds of addictions will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. Please sustain Rev. Wayne Pickford and the team as they lead the church to be a light and witness in their community. We pray for Wayne and the family as they come to terms with the recent diagnosis of Wayne’s Parkinson’s disease. May they have wisdom, patience and hope as they think about the future and await tests. May you keep sustaining and working through Berkeley Life Centre both now and into the future. We praise you for providing Samantha Trotter who is helping with the womens and children ministry. May there be more kids and families who come to be transformed by the gospel. May the Frozen Meals Ministry, Community BBQ and movie nights be an avenue for the church to care for those struggling and hear the good news. May Glenn, Inter Pastor, grow in his conviction, character and competence as he continues The Well Training Program and studies the Pentateuch.
- **Empowering Everyone with English in Jesus’ Name:** We praise you for the many people groups that are in Hurstville including from Nepal, Thailand, Latin America, Mongolia and China. May we have a heart for them to settle and live well in Australia and more importantly to find their true citizenship in Jesus. May the teachers and volunteers be a model of love and good works as they teach people about Jesus and English amidst sicknesses and illness amongst them and their families. May the students be connected with other church activities and to Jesus.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Australia:** Guide with your wisdom and power the leaders of the nation, so that everyone may live in peace and mutual trust, sharing with justice the resources of the earth. Give the people of this land a spirit of unselfishness, compassion and fairness both in their public and private life. May we live quiet and peaceful lives in order that people may come to a knowledge of the truth. We pray that you would give our leaders wisdom and a fear of you. We pray that many in our nation who are suffering and anxious may find hope, peace, comfort, life and purpose in the gospel of your Son. May Anthony Albanese, Chris Minns and other leaders lead Australia and NSW well including in the areas of Indigenous health, religious freedom, euthanasia, abortion, charity, housing and wars around the world.
- **CanCare:** Father God, we praise you for you are the God of compassion and love. You know what it means to face trials and pain and that you can sympathise with our weaknesses. We thank you for using CanCare to support people and their family and friends who are or have suffered from the ravages of cancer. May they serve them with Christ's love and to accompany them in the difficult fight against cancer. May God continue to lead and unite the CanCare team and give them the wisdom to care for this cohort. May God bless those suffering from cancer with His peace. We praise you that all 4 CanCare musical events in August have come to a fruitful and blessed finish. We give thanks that CanCare received many positive feedback and encouragements from the audience. We pray for another upcoming public drama event at Hurstville Club Central in September. May God guide all the preparation work and provide all the resources that they may need. Bless the event so that it doesn't just make a positive impact on lives but also draws non-believers to Christ.
- **Evangelism Teams and Programs:** Gracious Lord, our neighbours are lost and far away from you. We long for the opportunity to proclaim your name. Please give us the eyes to see those whom you have placed before us and be like Paul who was greatly distressed in Acts 17 when he saw Athens being full of idols. Whenever I open my mouth, may words be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel. We pray that as the seeds of the gospel may bear fruit as people are transferred from the dominion of darkness to the kingdom of light and Jesus.
- **Cantonese Congregations:** Lord, we pray for our brothers and sisters of the Cantonese congregation. We ask that You continue to guide them in pursuing our vision of a “secure attachment to Jesus” and our growth in it. May they gain a deeper understanding of Christ's heart and align their lives with Your will. May they rely on You in all things, seek Your guidance, and grow in Your love and strength. We pray for the Gospel class starting from July 14,  that the seekers may encounter Jesus through the study of your Word and joyfully embrace Him as their Saviour. May this class be a conduit for bringing more people to You, allowing them to experience Your salvation and love. Amen.
