| From the Passage | Gracious Father,<br><br>We thank You that You are the God of glory, full of weight and worth.<br><br>We praise You for the glory of Your Law, holy and good—yet we rejoice even more in the surpassing glory of the Gospel of Your Son.<br><br>Lord Jesus, we thank You that through Your death and resurrection, the veil has been lifted. You have forgiven our sins, clothed us in Your righteousness, and poured out Your Spirit to write Your law on our hearts.<br><br>Save us from making lesser glories our ambition. Thank You that from eternity past and into eternity future, we are known by You. And one day, we will know as we have been known.<br><br>Refresh us with this hope. Embolden us to confidently proclaim the Gospel of Jesus to all, that they too may know as they are known.<br><br>By Your Spirit, make us holy, transforming us from glory to glory, until we see Jesus face to face and live forever in the warmth of His light.<br><br>We pray this in His name,<br>Amen.

| Mission Partners | **High school scripture & chaplaincy** <br><br>Heavenly Father,<br><br>We come before you today with a heart full of gratitude for Semi and his dedication to serving you as an SRE teacher. We thank you for his willingness to share your Word with the students in the Georges River region.<br><br>Lord, we specifically lift up the scripture classes and lunchtime groups that he leads at GRC Hurstville Boys Campus, Sydney Technical High, and GRC Oatley Senior Campus. We pray that as Semi opens the scriptures with the students, you would open their hearts and minds to receive your truth.<br><br>We ask for your anointing upon Semi's teaching. Grant him wisdom, clarity, and boldness to communicate the saving work of your son, Jesus, who can take away our sins. We pray that through his faithful dedication to this work, many students would come to know you personally and be transformed by your love.<br><br>Bless Semi with renewed energy, protection, and encouragement in his ministry. Surround him with a strong support network and provide for all his needs.<br><br>In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.<br><br>**Mathys and PNG**<br><br>Heavenly Father,<br><br>We come before you today on behalf of the Mathys family, who are Wycliffe Bible Translators in PNG. Thank you for the time they were able to spend with us in June, informing us of their work going forward. As they have now returned to the field, please give them energy and rejuvenation to continue this valuable work of translating scripture for the people in PNG.<br><br>We lift up each family member to you, Lord. We pray for Calvin as he returns to his work as Aviation Maintenance Controller, for Ruth as she resumes her role as Translation Advisor to the Somba-Siawari team, and for Andreas and Petra as they return to school. We ask that you grant them focus, peace, and joy in their respective roles.<br><br>Prayer Requests:<br>We pray for the SIL-PNG Aviation department as it enters a period of significant change. We ask for your wisdom and provision for their leadership and staff.
<br>We pray for more staff in all roles that support Bible translation, especially translation advisors, aviation personnel, and schoolteachers. We ask that you call and equip more people for these vital ministries.<br><br>Praise Points:<br>We praise you for providing one of the original advisors to the Somba-Siawari translation project to provide expert input, which will reduce Ruth’s workload and speed up the completion of the Old Testament. We pray for the Somba-Siawari translation team as they check Isaiah. We pray for the eventual completion of the Old Testament and for regular workshops in Ukarumpa to be fruitful.<br><br>We commit this family into your loving hands, trusting that you will meet their every need and carry them through this time of transition. We ask all these things in the precious name of your Son, Jesus Christ.<br><br>Amen.|
