- **Mission & Vision - For Growing Deep:** Oh Lord, how We love your law! Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path. Thank you that Jesus has given us the Word of Eternal Life. Thank you that heaven and earth may pass away but our Lordâ€™s words will never pass away. Please help us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds by your Word. Please help us to deepen our understanding of and obedience to your Word.
