## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Collect**: Lord, let your continual pity cleanse and defend your church, and because it cannot continue in safety without your aid, keep it evermore by your help and goodness; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus**: Dear God, our loving and kind Father, you are full of grace and patience, and you always love us. You are holy and fair, but you never turn away from those who look for you. We feel safe and comforted with you, our God. We trust you with our lives and know your love never fails. As we come to you through Jesus, we ask for your mercy and help with everything we need. Let your Spirit work in us to grow love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.

- **Growing Deep**: Oh Lord, how We love your law! Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path. Thank you that Jesus has give us the Word of Eternal Life. Thank you that heaven and earth may pass away but our Lord’s words will never pass away. Please help us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds by your Word. Please help us to deepen our understanding of and obedience to your Word. 

- **Sermon**: Heavenly Father, We come to you with grateful hearts for your many mercies and sadness for our sins. Our lives and relationships have been shaped by the ways of this world and not  the world to come. Out of our fears and insecurities, greed and malice, we seek control, power and advantages. We want our own way. And when we don’t, we lash out in anger, resentment and selfishness. We have been harsh with our wives, and defiant to our husbands.  We have dishonoured our parents, and embittered our children. We have fallen short of your glory and hurt the people we love. Forgive us. Thank you that Jesus has saved us from all these and more. Thank you that we are not defined by our failures but by Jesus, our life. Cleanse our hearts and renew our spirits. Help us to bloom where we are planted. May Christ shines through us in all our moments in life so that all may see his beauty and glory and come to acknowledge him as their lord and saviour as we do. In His name we pray, Amen.

May you raise up Christians and leaders in the university and church especially as numbers grow. May you save JC’s immediate and extended family.
