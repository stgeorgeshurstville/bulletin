Almighty God, you alone can order the unruly wills and passions of sinful men: grant to your people that they may love what you command and desire what you promise, that so, among the many and varied changes of the world, our hearts may surely there be fixed where true joys are to be found; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

| From the Passage | Heavenly Father,<br><br>Thank You for not remaining distant, but for sending Your Son, Jesus, to reveal Your love and draw us into it. Thank You that in Him, we see Your true self. Open our eyes to behold Your love more clearly each day.<br><br>Without Your work and Your grace, those we meet remain in darkness, just as we once did. Have mercy on our world, Lord, as You have had mercy on us.<br><br>Free us to speak, not out of obligation, but from the overflow of encountering Your light and receiving Your love. Cast out our fears by filling us with deeper love for You and for the lost. Give us wisdom to know what to say and when to speak—and humility to listen when silence is needed.<br><br>May our lives and words point always to Jesus, in whose name we pray, Amen.|

|Special Items & Events | KYCK, Easter markets, Lord, we thank You for the opportunity to reach into the community through the Easter night market and to share the joyful message of Your resurrection. Thank You for watching over the entire event and for using brothers and sisters from all congregations to serve together in unity, bearing witness to Your love. We ask that You bless each brother and sister who served, and continue to work in the hearts of those who were reached. Draw them to know You.
