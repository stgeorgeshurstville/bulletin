| **From the Passage** | Father, <br><br>You have been our dwelling place throughout generation after generation. Generation after generation, you have always been just and merciful. Just that you do not ignore our sin, but merciful that you would give us only begotten Son. When we have trouble in this life, remind us of your goodness. Remind us of who you are, so that we would come to and groan. And bless us with other brothers and sisters to groan with us, so that we can help each other to look forward to when we are home with You. Teach us to number our days so that we may get a heart of wisdom. Return, O Lord Jesus! How long? Have pity on your church! Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. Give us confidence in you when we groan, give us confidence because you’ve given us the Spirit. And for all our days, help us to live lives that are pleasing in your eyes. Increase our yearning to be home with Him. In Jesus’ name, Amen. |

| **Mission Partners** | *Berkeley Life Centre* <br><br> General info: Berkeley Life Centre desires to see Jesus Christ transforming lives to transform a community. They minister in the south coast in an area where many people are from a low socioeconomic background. People are coming to faith and the church is making a positive impact. Berkeley is going through a transition period as their senior minister Wayne finishes up his time there as he goes into retirement and Beejai starts up as the new senior minister. Here is a prayer that reflects this. Heavenly Father, we thank you for the recent seasons of fellowship, from our Light Up Berkeley event to the combined lunch and, most recently, Wayne's retirement. We are so grateful for Wayne's faithful service and for his unwavering heart for preaching your Word and seeing souls won for Jesus. We pray for your continued blessing on him and Mary in their retirement. As Beejai steps into this new leadership role, we pray for your wisdom and strength to guide him. We ask that you bless his vision for new ministries and for building relationships in the community. We lift up the Op Shop, the Children's and Families ministry, and all who serve, asking that you would provide volunteers and guidance to grow your reach. May we continue to be a community that honors Christ and loves our community well. In Jesus' name, Amen. |
| **Church Ministries** | *EAL/D* <br><br> Heavenly Father, we thank you for the students who come to our Everyday English Ministry that takes place every Wednesday during the school term. We are so grateful for all the students who come every week and for the faithful service of our teachers and helpers, Catherine, Amy, Chi Wa, Daniel, and Doris. We pray that you would help our church to deepen our relationships with the students who don't know you, so that we may share the good news of the Bible and they may come to know you as their Lord and Saviour. In Jesus' name, Amen. <br><br> *Redevelopment* <br><br> Awaiting updates from staff team. |
