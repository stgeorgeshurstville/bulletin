**From the Passage**
<br><br> Holy, holy, holy are you, Lord Almighty.  
The whole earth is full of your glory.  
You dwell in unapproachable light, yet you have made yourself known — the King seated on the throne, exalted in holiness and splendour.  
We come before you in awe and humility.  
Lord, we confess that like Isaiah, we are people of unclean lips and unclean hearts.  
We have stolen your glory, seeking honour for ourselves.  
We have exchanged the glory of the Creator for the things you have made — chasing after comfort, achievement, wealth, or reputation instead of you.  
As your people, called to reflect your light, we have often hidden it;  
we have dimmed your glory through pride, fear, and forgetfulness.  
Forgive us, Lord.  
Thank you that in your mercy, you do not leave us in our darkness.  
As the burning coal touched Isaiah’s lips, so the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin.  
Thank you that in him your holiness meets us in grace —  
that our guilt is taken away, and our sin atoned for.  
Thank you that Jesus, the true image of God, perfectly reflected your love and faithfulness,  
and now restores your image in us.  
Father, make us mirrors of your glory once again.  
Let your light shine in our hearts through the knowledge of your glory in the face of Christ.  
Help us to walk in holiness, to live for your praise,  
and to show your goodness, love, and justice in all we do.  
When the world is dark, let your people shine —  
not with our own light, but with yours.  
We pray this in the name of Jesus Christ,  
the Light of the world.  
Amen.
