## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** Lord God, the strength of all who put their trust in you: mercifully accept our prayers, and because through the weakness of our mortal nature we can do nothing good without you, grant us the help of your grace, that in keeping your commandments we may please you both in word and deed; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Loving and compassionate Father, You are full of grace and kindness, patient and overflowing with love and faithfulness. Your holiness and fairness shine brightly, yet you never turn away from those who seek you. We find our safety and comfort in you, our God. Our lives are entrusted to your care, and we trust in your unfailing love. O faithful God, as we come before your throne of grace through Jesus, we humbly ask for your mercy and grace to meet our every need. May your Spirit work within us, producing in us the beautiful fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In the precious name of your beloved Son, we pray. Amen.
- **The Cross:** Father, Expand my heart, empower my speech, and give me words to proclaim your glory. At the cross, your grace removes my burdens, where justice and mercy meet in Christ's sacrifice. Christ endured anguish to bring me joy, was cast off to welcome me in, and suffered for my sins to grant me heaven's best. He wept to dry my tears, groaned to give me endless song, and bore pain for my eternal health. In his death, Christ conquered sin and death, and opened the way to eternal life. Help me to adore you with my words and actions, may every breath be praise, and every step filled with joy. As I see my enemies defeated and sin overcome by Christ's sacrifice, may I go forth in confidence, knowing that the cross is mighty to save. Amen.
- **Mission:** Our gracious Father, thank you for the privilege of calling us to join in your mission. Thank you that under you what we do makes a difference in the world. We pray therefore that you will save those around us and to transform them into the likeness of Jesus. Please use us to make disciples of the nations, love our neighbours. Please Father, glorify yourself, through our labour in your Son. We pray that we will not be consumers but contributors to the ministries that you have called us to. 
- **Sermon:** Your greatness is beyond measure, your goodness indescribable, and your grace overflowing. I could sooner count the sands on the shore than number your blessings toward me. I only know a part, but that part exceeds all praise.
I thank you for personal mercies: a measure of health, preservation of body, comforts of house and home, sufficiency of food and clothing, continuance of mental powers, my family, their mutual help and support, the delights of domestic harmony and peace, the seats now filled that might have been vacant, my country, church, Bible, and faith.

  But, O, how I mourn my sin, ingratitude, and vileness, the days that add to my guilt, the scenes that witness my offending tongue. All things in heaven and earth, around and within, condemn me — the sun which sees my misdeeds, the darkness which is light to you, the cruel accuser who justly charges me, the good angels who have been provoked to leave me, your countenance which scans my secret sins, your righteous law, your holy Word, my sin-soiled conscience, my private and public life, my neighbours, and myself — all write dark things against me.

  I deny them not, frame no excuse, but confess, "Father, I have sinned." Yet still I live and fly repenting to your outstretched arms; you will not cast me off, for Jesus brings me near, you will not condemn me, for he died in my stead, you will not mark my mountains of sin, for he levelled all, and his beauty covers my deformities.

O my God, I bid farewell to sin by clinging to his cross, hiding in his wounds, and sheltering in his side. (prayer for mercy from the Vision of Valley). 


## Weekly Prayer Points

- **Indigenous Australians:** Holy Father, God of Love, You are the Creator of this land and of all good things. Our hope is in you because you gave your Son Jesus to reconcile the world to you. We pray for your strength and grace to forgive, accept and love one another, as you have loved, forgiven and accepted us in the sacrifice of your Son. Give us the courage to accept the realities of our history so that we may build a better future for our nation. Teach us to respect all cultures. Teach us to care for our land and waters. Help us to share justly the resources of this land. Help us to bring about spiritual and social change to improve the quality of life for all groups in our communities especially the disadvantaged. Help young people find true dignity and self esteem in Christ. May your power and love be the foundations on which we build our families, communities and nation. Amen.

And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross. Colossians 1:18-20

## Mission Partner Focus

- **Persecuted Christians:** We thank you for sending Jesus who is sovereign and came to save the world by sacrificing himself. Please give patience and perseverance to those who are being persecuted for the faith whether in Australia through pressure or in other parts of the world through physical persecution like North Korea, Somalia and Libya. May we be an model of what it means to have a calling in this life and a confidence for the next one. May we look to you as the judge and respond with love rather than revenge as we trust that you can make the blood of the martyrs into the seed of the church.

You can sign up for more prayer points and updates of persecuted Christians from [Open Doors](https://vom.com.au/pray-for-the-persecuted-church/) and [Voice of the Martyrs](https://vom.com.au/prayer/).
- **Compassion:** Jesus came to seek and to save the lost. You tell us that true religion is to visit orphans and widows in their affliction. May Compassion Australia seek to release children from poverty in Jesus’ name. May we do what we can to love children and their families so that they will mature physically, mentally, socially and most importantly spiritually. May we prayerfully invest in the lives of the children in Sumba Indonesia and see a whole region won and living for God. We praise you that over 100 children are sponsored by members of our church. May we keep praying, communicating and supporting them and their family. May these children have enough sustenance, health and support as they participate in the program and activities. May you give wisdom to our 11 partner churches in the area to love and care for the children and prepare for the mission trip in February 2025.

May there be tranquillity so that we can live godly and holy lives and people can come to the knowledge of the truth.

May we keep encouraging each other on Sundays but also during the week.
