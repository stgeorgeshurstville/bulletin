## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** Lord God, the strength of all who put their trust in you: mercifully accept our prayers, and because through the weakness of our mortal nature we can do nothing good without you, grant us the help of your grace, that in keeping your commandments we may please you both in word and deed; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Loving and compassionate Father, You are full of grace and kindness, patient and overflowing with love and faithfulness. Your holiness and fairness shine brightly, yet you never turn away from those who seek you. We find our safety and comfort in you, our God. Our lives are entrusted to your care, and we trust in your unfailing love. O faithful God, as we come before your throne of grace through Jesus, we humbly ask for your mercy and grace to meet our every need. May your Spirit work within us, producing in us the beautiful fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In the precious name of your beloved Son, we pray. Amen.
- **The Cross:** Father, Expand my heart, empower my speech, and give me words to proclaim your glory. At the cross, your grace removes my burdens, where justice and mercy meet in Christ's sacrifice. Christ endured anguish to bring me joy, was cast off to welcome me in, and suffered for my sins to grant me heaven's best. He wept to dry my tears, groaned to give me endless song, and bore pain for my eternal health. In his death, Christ conquered sin and death, and opened the way to eternal life. Help me to adore you with my words and actions, may every breath be praise, and every step filled with joy. As I see my enemies defeated and sin overcome by Christ's sacrifice, may I go forth in confidence, knowing that the cross is mighty to save. Amen.
- **Mission:** Our gracious Father, thank you for the privilege of calling us to join in your mission. Thank you that under you what we do makes a difference in the world. We pray therefore that you will save those around us and to transform them into the likeness of Jesus. Please use us to make disciples of the nations, love our neighbours. Please Father, glorify yourself, through our labour in your Son. We pray that we will not be consumers but contributors to the ministries that you have called us to. 
- **Sermon:** Your greatness is beyond measure, your goodness indescribable, and your grace overflowing. I could sooner count the sands on the shore than number your blessings toward me. I only know a part, but that part exceeds all praise.
I thank you for personal mercies: a measure of health, preservation of body, comforts of house and home, sufficiency of food and clothing, continuance of mental powers, my family, their mutual help and support, the delights of domestic harmony and peace, the seats now filled that might have been vacant, my country, church, Bible, and faith.
  But, O, how I mourn my sin, ingratitude, and vileness, the days that add to my guilt, the scenes that witness my offending tongue. All things in heaven and earth, around and within, condemn me — the sun which sees my misdeeds, the darkness which is light to you, the cruel accuser who justly charges me, the good angels who have been provoked to leave me, your countenance which scans my secret sins, your righteous law, your holy Word, my sin-soiled conscience, my private and public life, my neighbours, and myself — all write dark things against me.
  I deny them not, frame no excuse, but confess, "Father, I have sinned." Yet still I live and fly repenting to your outstretched arms; you will not cast me off, for Jesus brings me near, you will not condemn me, for he died in my stead, you will not mark my mountains of sin, for he levelled all, and his beauty covers my deformities.
  O my God, I bid farewell to sin by clinging to his cross, hiding in his wounds, and sheltering in his side. (prayer for mercy from the Vision of Valley). 


## Weekly Prayer Points

- **Indigenous Australians:** Holy Father, God of Love, You are the Creator of this land and of all good things. Our hope is in you because you gave your Son Jesus to reconcile the world to you. We pray for your strength and grace to forgive, accept and love one another, as you have loved, forgiven and accepted us in the sacrifice of your Son. Give us the courage to accept the realities of our history so that we may build a better future for our nation. Teach us to respect all cultures. Teach us to care for our land and waters. Help us to share justly the resources of this land. Help us to bring about spiritual and social change to improve the quality of life for all groups in our communities especially the disadvantaged. Help young people find true dignity and self esteem in Christ. May your power and love be the foundations on which we build our families, communities and nation. Amen.
And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross. Colossians 1:18-20

## Mission Partner Focus

- **Local High School Scripture:** Loving Father, we thank you that you want all people to come to a saving knowledge of you. We ask that the high schoolers in our area (especially at Hurstville Boys, Sydney Tech and Oatley High) will see Jesus as the way, the truth and the life. May you help students to find their identity and security in Jesus particularly when things get busy, life doesn’t work out as planned and the future may seem confusing and meaningless. We praise you for providing Semi Kolikata to replace Aywan Suleiman. Please help him to transition well, make good connections with the school and students and share the good news.
- **Papua New Guinea and Mathys:** Father God, we realise that all flesh is like grass yet your word remains forever. We ask that you will use the Mathys and other bible translators to transform PNG for Jesus with your precious and powerful word. We pray that the Mathys and their children Petra, Andi and Jakob will keep growing in Christ and being missional. May the 17 million people in PNG come to know Christ as their Lord and Saviour.

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Hurstville:** We pray that the 30,000 people in Hurstville, with many from different cultures and countries, will come to know Jesus as their Lord and Saviour. May we have a heart for the people you have placed around us. May we be lights in our neighbourhood which is in darkness and filled with anxiety and uncertainty. May we be mindful of the changing demographics and seek to share the gospel with them. May Chris Minns (NSW Premier and Legislative Assembly Member for Kogarah), Linda Burney (House Representative for Barton), David Coleman (House Representative for Banks) and Nick Katris (Mayor) know who has the ultimate authority and steward with love, justice and wisdom. 
- **Discipleship Groups:** We praise you for the opportunity to study your word together and grow as disciples of Jesus. May we have clear direction, wisdom and discipline as we spur each other to have a secure attachment in Jesus.
- **Pastoral Care Team:** Father, you sent your Son to heal the brokenhearted. May we cast our burdens and anxieties upon you knowing that you can sympathise with our weaknesses and care for us. May the peace of God sustain us as we bear the hope of the gospel, point people to heaven and carry each other’s burdens.
- **People with Disabilities:** Thank you that all people are made in your image. We pray for those with disabilities that they would know their true value as your image-bearer. We pray that your love in Jesus will heal them of their experience and rejection and pain. We pray that they will know of Jesus’ sufficiency in their experience of chronic pain and suffering. We pray for forgiveness for the ways that we have often treated people with disabilities. Please help us to be like Jesus in welcoming those with disabilities into our church and lives. Please open our eyes to see them as whole human beings. Please help us to learn from those with disabilities as well as minister to them. We pray that by our love for one another, the world may see you. We look forward to the day when Jesus returns, when we will be given Resurrection bodies. Amen.
- **Support Ministries:** Everlasting God, we give thanks for the many volunteers who have been faithfully serving in different ministries at church. Please strengthen and sustain them with patience and understanding that they may love and care for your people. Please grant that together they may follow and help others to follow Jesus Christ. May they offer their gifts and talents to build up the church which is the body of Christ. We ask this for the communication, vestry, cleaning, flower, bulletin, meals, AV, sound, technology and the many other teams. May people come under the wings of your love and salvation.
- **New Life Nepalese Church:** We thank you for our Nepalese brothers and sisters who share our building. May they grow in their knowledge of your love for them and continue to speak the truth in love to their community. We pray that through their ministry, many more Nepalese would come to serve the Lord Jesus Christ. May they embrace people from all cultural backgrounds, ⁠⁠grow in faith as well as in numbers and have more labourers to spread the good news of the kingdom of God. 
- **Singles, Widows and Orphans:** We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
