Lord, we pray, absolve your from their offences; that through your bountiful goodness we may be set free from the chains of those sins which in our frailty we have committed: grant this, heavenly Father, for the sake of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour.

| **From the Passage** | Heavenly Father, we come before You with a necessary confession. We acknowledge that we constantly live under spiritual warfare, and we repeatedly fall for the devil's schemes, allowing his taunts—like Sennacherib's psychological attacks—to undermine our belief in Your goodness and truth. We confess that we are too quick to doubt Your promises and seek false security in the world's lies.<br><br>
We look to the model of King Hezekiah who laid the letter of the taunt before You, but we thank You that his faith was merely a pointer to the perfect reality we find in Your Son. Thank You, Lord, that Jesus is perfect and obedient, who conquered every temptation and secured eternal victory for us. We praise You that His flawless obedience is credited to our account, enabling and empowering us to live fully for Your glory by the Spirit's power.<br><br>
Lord our God, in our world that heckles and taunts Your holy name and rages against Your Anointed King, grant us the grace to stand firm. Help us to continue to love, be gentle, and respond with dignity, knowing that Your word is the final word. We pray for the spiritual sight to see past the world's temporary arrogance, knowing You will bring all those who mock to account.
<br><br>Deliver us, O God, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone are God, and Jesus Christ is Lord. Amen
