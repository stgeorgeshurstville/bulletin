## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
  
- **Collect:** Merciful God, it is by your gift alone that your faithful people offer you true and acceptable service; grant that we may so faithfully serve you in this life that we fail not finally to obtain your heavenly promises; through the merits of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Mission:** Our gracious Father, thank you for the privilege of calling us to join in your mission. Thank you that under you what we do makes a difference in the world. We pray therefore that you will save those around us and to transform them into the likeness of Jesus. Please use us to make disciples of the nations, love our neighbours. Please Father, glorify yourself, through our labour in your Son. We pray that we will not be consumers but contributors to the ministries that you have called us to. 
- **Church Sermon:** Gracious Father and Lord, O Lord, you have searched me and you know me. You created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. 

  Sorry that we have often let our minds be conformed to the patterns of this world, and have made an idol of marriage, our happiness and fulfilment. Sorry for the way that we have disdained your gift of singleness and privileged marriage. Thank you for giving us the gift or marriage and the gift of singleness. Thank you that Jesus has redeemed both by His own body. Thank you that on the day of our Lord we will finally experience the Oneness with you and each other, through the marriage of the Lamb and us His people.  

  Please help us to see ourselves and our gifts through the Gospel of Jesus. Please help us when we struggle in our marriage or in our singleness, to find contentment. Please help us to use the situations that you have put us in to point others to the sufficiency of Jesus and the world that is to come. 

  Search us, O God, and know our heart; test us and know our anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in us, and lead us in the way everlasting. Amen. 


## Weekly Prayer Points
- **The Lord will raise the workers for children ministry at 4pm.**
- **Father’s Day**: Dear Heavenly Father, on this Father’s Day, it’s a supreme joy to affirm that you are the Father we’ve always longed for and needed. Our most loving and engaged fathers have been a wonderful taste of what it means to be your beloved children, but they could never be to us what you are.  Thank you for adopting us, through the finished work of Jesus. Thank you for freeing us from our slavery to sin and our orphan-like ways; and for giving us the Spirit of Sonship, a secure place in your family, and an inheritance that can never spoil or fade. Thank you for being the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort. You are the one from whom evey family in heaven and on earth is named. Thank you for promising to complete the work you began in us, and for always and only, disciplining us in love. Father, thank you for the grace to forgive our earthly fathers who didn’t love us as you intended—including those who broke our trust and hearts. Continue to heal us, Lord, help us to love them, and free us to parent to your glory. We ask you to give wisdom, strength, patience and humility to those who are fathers, to raise their children in the love and fear of You. Lastly, Father, we thank you for the spiritual dads you’ve given us—the gospel-fathers who help us discover more and more of the multi-dimensional love of Christ. So every Amen we pray, we pray in Jesus’ merciful and mighty name.

May Compassion Australia seek to release children from poverty in Jesus’ name. May we do what we can to love children and their families so that they will mature physically, mentally, socially and most importantly spiritually.

May you give wisdom to our 11 partner churches in the area to love and care for the children.

For those who personally sponsor a child, may we keep praying, communicating and supporting them and their family. 
- **Persecuted Christians:** We thank you for sending Jesus who is sovereign and came to save the world by sacrificing himself. Please give patience and perseverance to those who are being persecuted for the faith. May they be an model and example of what it means to have a calling in life and a confidence for the future. May they seek to do the will of you rather than themselves. May there be justice. If this isn’t achieved, may they keep looking to you as the judge and respond with love rather than revenge.

## Regular Prayer Points

- **World:** We pray that you will lead the nations of the world in the ways of righteousness and peace. Please guide our rulers in wisdom and justice. May there be tranquillity so that we can live godly and holy lives and people can come to the knowledge of the truth. May we submit to those you’ve placed in authority and ultimately to your reign and rule. May people live and long for the new world to come rather than seek to gain the world and forfeit our souls. 

- **Redevelopment:** Our Gracious God and Heavenly Father, You know our needs. You have richly provided and we know that you will continue to provide what we need for the mission that you have called us to. May our faithful stewardship bear witness to the love of Jesus Christ in our lives. We pray this in the name of the one who is building us into a spiritual house for a holy priesthood and to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to you.

- **Sunday Services:** Thank you heavenly Father for our ascended King. Thank you for the gifts of apostles, evangelists, pastors, teachers, service leaders, musicians and all those who serve us. We pray that you will use their service for the building up of the church, that we may reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of your Son and become mature. We ask this for Bible readers, service leaders, musicians, welcomers and other volunteers. 

- **Staff and Parish Council:** We praise you for the leaders you’ve appointed over us. May they love and care for the church of God which you obtained with your own blood. May they prayerfully set forth the life giving word through their lives and teaching. Clothe them with holiness, zeal and servant heartedness. We pray for our wardens and parish councillors, may they have wisdom, insight and passion to see our church family be spiritually transformed for your glory. Please use them to help us stay focused and accountable with the resources you’ve given us. 

- **English Congregations:** May we have Jesus as the centre of our lives in 2023. May God use our programs and plans to see us deepen our trust, have a personal relationship with God and have a faith that is public. 

- **Families:** We remember the families of our church community. We pray that despite the busyness, you will be an ever presence and comfort to them. Please help kids and their families to set the right priorities, the discipline to say ‘no’. May our love for and devotion to you be our greatest desire. We bow our knees before you the Father from whom every family is named. Help parents and spiritual uncles and aunties to impart the knowledge of you and of your love; and children to respond with love and obedience. We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
