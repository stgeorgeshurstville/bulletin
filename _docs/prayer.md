## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** HO God, the king of glory, you have exalted your only Son Jesus Christ with great triumph to your kingdom in heaven: leave us not desolate, but send your Holy Spirit to strengthen us, and exalt us to where our Saviour Christ has gone before, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for evermore. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Loving and compassionate Father, You are full of grace and kindness, patient and overflowing with love and faithfulness. Your holiness and fairness shine brightly, yet you never turn away from those who seek you. We find our safety and comfort in you, our God. Our lives are entrusted to your care, and we trust in your unfailing love. O faithful God, as we come before your throne of grace through Jesus, we humbly ask for your mercy and grace to meet our every need. May your Spirit work within us, producing in us the beautiful fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In the precious name of your beloved Son, we pray. Amen.
- **Saviour:**: God of all grace, You have given me a Savior. Grant me the faith to rely on Him completely, making Him my desire, hope, and glory. May I find refuge in Him, build my life upon His teachings, and walk in His ways. Let me follow His example, heed His guidance, and trust in His intercession. May I never be ashamed of Him, but proudly bear His name and teachings. Keep me from being swayed by the world's allurements or frightened by its threats. Help me to remember that this world is not my home, but that I am a pilgrim seeking a heavenly country. May I grow daily in readiness for that eternal home, and may all I do be done in the name of the Savior. Amen.
- **Growing Up:** Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day.
- **Sermon:** Father, thank you for speaking to us. Sorry for rejecting it and treating your message with contempt. Sorry for treating your love, mercy and forgiveness with contempt and not taking sin seriously. Sorry for the harm this has done to us and others. May we repent and live lives of true faith – not of superficial sacrifice but of love.   


## Weekly Prayer Points
- **Mother's Day:** Heavenly Father, we thank you for the way you have made us relational creatures, and for the blessing of families. We thank you for the gift of mothers, and for the significant role they play not only in families, but in communities as well. We pray for those who might long to have this role but for whatever reason have not received this opportunity. We also pray for those who are mothers but who are mother alone as a result of death, separation or divorce. Please comfort all these women in any grief they may experience this Mother's Day. Help them to keep casting their cares onto you. May we find our identity, significance and joy in Jesus. Please guard them from despair and bitterness and instead, please redeem their situations, helping them to use their disposition to nurture those you have placed around them. We thank you for the blessing of being part of your family, and for the significant role all women can play as spiritual mothers within our church families and communities.
