## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Collect**: Lord, give your people grace to withstand the temptations of the world, the flesh, and the devil, and with pure hearts and minds to follow you the only God; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus**: Dear God, our loving and kind Father, you are full of grace and patience, and you always love us. You are holy and fair, but you never turn away from those who look for you. We feel safe and comforted with you, our God. We trust you with our lives and know your love never fails. As we come to you through Jesus, we ask for your mercy and help with everything we need. Let your Spirit work in us to grow love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.

- **Mission**: Our gracious Father, thank you for the privilege of calling us to join in your mission. Thank you that under you what we do makes a difference in the world. We pray therefore that you will save those around us and to transform them into the likeness of Jesus. Please use us to make disciples of the nations, love our neighbours. Please Father, glorify yourself, through our labour in your Son. We pray that we will not be consumers but contributors to the ministries that you have called us to. 

- **Sermon (9:30am)**: We are sorry for when we are not happy with you or what you give us. Thank you for Jesus who gave us life. May we use the money you give us to help others and point to you. May we use money differently from non Christians. Amen. 

- **Sermon (4:00pm)**: We are sorry for when we fall into temptation and the traps of Satan. We are sorry for when we are discontent with you or what we have (or don’t have). We praise you for Jesus who though he was rich became poor so that through his poverty we may become rich. Help us to understand all the spiritual blessings we have in Christ. May these truths be a model and motivation for how we use our money. May how we think and use money glorify you, bring about good and turn heads as it’ll be so different to how other people deal with money. Amen.

## Mission Related Prayer Points
- **Local High School Scripture with Semi:** Loving Father, we thank you that you want all people to come to a saving knowledge of you. We ask that the high schoolers in our area (especially at Hurstville Boys, Sydney Tech and Oatley High) will see Jesus as the way, the truth and the life. May you help students to find their identity and security in Jesus particularly when things get busy, life doesn’t work out as planned and the future may seem confusing and meaningless. We praise you for providing Semi Kolikata. Please help him to transition well, make good connections with the school and students and share the good news. We thank you that through him students are wanting to read their Bible, come to church and invite their friends. We ask that this will keep happening and growing. 

- **Mellisa Wang:** We praise you for the people from different nations coming to Adelaide University. May they not only settle well but more importantly find their citizenship in heaven. We praise you for giving Mellisa the desire and means to share the gospel with others. May the females she is reading the Bible with keep being a source of encouragement and a way to grow each other in maturity. Please keep sustaining Mellisa in godliness, strength and wisdom as she keeps sharing the good news. Help her to keep realising that a Christian is about who we are in Jesus rather than what we do for him.

- **Papua New Guinea and Mathys:** Father God, we realise that all flesh is like grass yet your word remains forever. May the 17 million people in PNG come to know Christ as their Lord and Saviour. We ask that you will use the Mathys and other bible translators to transform PNG for Jesus with your precious and powerful word. We pray that Petra, Andi and Jakob will keep growing in Christ and being missional. Help Jakob transition well with studying in Melbourne.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Hurstville:** We pray that the 30,000 people in Hurstville, with many from different cultures and countries, will come to know Jesus as their Lord and Saviour. May we have a heart for the people you have placed around us. May we be lights in our neighbourhood which is in darkness and filled with anxiety and uncertainty. May we be mindful of the changing demographics and seek to share the gospel with them. 

- **Discipleship Groups:** Pray that the seed of God’s word will be planted and watered. Help us to have a secure attachment to Jesus especially as we look at Colossians. 

- **Pastoral Care Team:** Father, you are gently and lowly. You sent your Son to heal the brokenhearted. May we cast our burdens and anxieties upon you knowing that you can sympathise with our weaknesses and care for us. May the peace of God sustain us as we bear the hope of the gospel, point people to heaven and carry each other’s burdens. 

- **People with Disabilities:** Thank you that all people are made in your image. We pray for those with disabilities that they would know their true value as your image-bearer. We pray that your love in Jesus will heal them of their experience and rejection and pain. We pray that they will know of Jesus’ sufficiency in their experience of chronic pain and suffering, that they will learn to form healthy relationships. We pray for forgiveness for the ways that we have often treated people with disabilities. Please help us to be like Jesus in welcoming those with disabilities into our church and lives. Please open our eyes to see them as whole human beings. Please help us to learn from those with disabilities as well as minister to them. We pray that by our love for one another, the world may see you. We look forward to the day when Jesus returns, when we will be given Resurrection bodies. Amen.

- **Support Ministries:** Everlasting God, we give thanks for the many volunteers who have been faithfully serving in different ministries at church especially in this challenging period of time. Please strengthen and sustain them with patience and understanding that they may love and care for your people. Please grant that together they may follow and help others to follow Jesus Christ. May they offer their given gifts and talents to build up the church which is the body of Christ. We ask this for the communication, vestry, cleaning, flower, bulletin, meals, AV, sound, technology and other teams.

- **New Life Nepalese Church:** We thank you for our Nepalese brothers and sisters who share our building. May they grow in their knowledge of your love for them and continue to speak the truth in love to their community. We pray that through their ministry, many more Nepalese would come to serve the Lord Jesus Christ.

- **Singles, Widows and Orphans:** We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
