  <ins>A Prayer for the Sick and Sorrowing at Christmas</ins>

  God of all comfort and Father of compassion we pray for those for whom the Christmas season is very hard.  
  We pray for those seeking refuge from family violence, at risk of homelessness, or sufferers of addictions to alcohol, substances or gambling.  
  We pray for those who will grieve the loss of loved ones who have departed this world since last Christmas, for those who are estranged from family members, for those who are ill or alone, for parents who fear they cannot provide for their children this Christmas and for children who will not see their parents.  
  May they know that you sent your Son into the world, to the lowly, the ordinary, the weary and the worried, so that we might know that you are with us; that sin and death and the devil will not win; that we are loved; and that our true home is with you.
  Thank you for all those, including our churches and Anglicare, who will partner to provide presents, food, and true and lasting hope to many this Christmas.
  We ask it in the name of him who died for sin and was raised again, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
  
  <ins>A Christmas Prayer for Peace</ins>

  Sovereign Lord, ruler and judge of the nations,
  Unto us a Son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders.
  We long for the day when every warrior’s boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be fuel for the fire.
  Have mercy we pray on this broken and divided world and bring peace – in Israel and the Palestinian territories, in Lebanon and Syria, in the Ukraine, in Sudan, Myanmar and Yemen. 
  Especially Father we pray for children caught up in conflicts not of their own making, for millions of displaced people, for women who do not know where their husbands, sons and fathers are. 
  Give wisdom, courage, urgency and diplomacy to the leaders of the nations that they may seek the welfare of their people with justice, righteousness and compassion. 
  We ask it in the name of the One of whom the greatness of his government and peace will know no end, Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
