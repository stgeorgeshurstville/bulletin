Thank you that even now the just has the Gospel has come to us, it is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world. We pray that many in our generation will hear and truly understand you grace. Please help us to be godly in life, resilient in ministry, servant-hearted, Biblical in life, thought and ministry, and able to love and minister faithfully, compassionately and effectively in different and changing contexts, cooperating with one another, humble, wise, prayerful, reflective, energetic and effective. Please help us to take our faith in Jesus beyond the walls of the church into our workplace, school, where we live and where we holiday. Please help us to have a compassion for the lost like Jesus.

Please give us the words to say. Please save our neighbours through us.

- **Church Sermon:** We praise you for demonstrating your love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. We are sorry for the many times we are sinful, selfish and unloving. Help us to realise that we gain and are nothing without love. Help us to know what we’ll be like in heaven and that God is love. May we love others constantly and continuously especially when we find it hard and inconvenient. May we use what we have and do what we can in love. Amen. 


## Weekly Prayer Points
- **Conflict in the middle east** God of the nations,
whose kingdom rules over all,
have mercy on our broken and divided world.
In the land of our Saviour’s birth,
banish the spirit that makes for war.
Please give wisdom to those you have placed in authority,
Rescue the captives, shield those in danger, and bind up the broken hearted.
For those fighting for justice, may they be strengthened by your grace.
For those walking in darkness, may the light of your face shine upon them.
Above all, we pray that the peoples of Israel and the Middle East will find everlasting hope in you.
And in the land of your Son’s redeeming death and resurrection,
turn hearts to look to the Saviour and live.
Bring peace, Lord, while we wait for Christ's coming and rule,
When all people will beat their swords into plowshares,
When nation will not take up sword against nation,
And when every tear will be wiped away
by the Prince of Peace and Lord of Lords,
Amen

Give us the courage to accept the realities of our history so that we may build a better future for our nation. Teach us to respect all cultures. Teach us to care for our land and waters. Help us to share justly the resources of this land. Help us to bring about spiritual and social change to improve the quality of life for all groups in our communities, especially the disadvantaged.

Enable them by your Spirit to resist the power of sin and give themselves to you as a living sacrifice. May they not be conformed to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of their mind, so that they may serve and please you in every way.
