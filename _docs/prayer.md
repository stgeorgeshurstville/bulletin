**Mission and Vision** 
<br><br> *Shine for Jesus, Everywhere, Anytime:*  
Thank You for calling us to be Your people and for giving our church a vision to shine for Jesus—everywhere, anytime. Strengthen us to live out this mission with love, humility, and courage. Help us reach our community and the nations with the light of Christ, building one another up in faith and serving with joy. May all we do bring glory to Your name and draw others to Your saving grace.
In Jesus’ name we pray, Amen.


**Global and Nation** 
<br><br> *Local*:  
We thank you Lord  for placing us in the heart of Hurstville—a community rich in culture and diversity. We pray for Your peace, justice, and love to dwell among our neighbours. Open doors for us to share the hope of Jesus with people from every nation and language. Strengthen local families, schools, and businesses; bring comfort to the lonely, the sick, and the struggling. May our church be a light in this city, reflecting Christ’s compassion and truth in all we do. Amen.

General info: There are >800 languages spoken in Papua New Guinea, but only 13 have complete bibles. Calvin and Ruth work alongside Papua New Guineans in roles that support the ongoing ministry of bible translation. Calvin is an aircraft maintenance engineer, in order to provide transport and logistics support for bible translators. Ruth provides training for the bible translators, so that locals can take the lead in this work.

FOCUS is a group for international students at Adelaide Uni. Mellisa seeks to support their student committee in running the group's weekly activities. She also meets one to one with female students to disciple them through reading the Bible and prayer. These are some prayer points and prayers from her latest Newsletter
*1.  For Fiona (New Christian)*
- **Context:** Fiona is a recent convert who put her faith in Jesus after the Mid Year Conference (MYC) and has had a huge hunger for God's word ever since. 
- **Prayer:** "Please keep praying that God's power will guard Fiona through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."

*2. Students: Shifting Focus to God's Eternal Will*
- **Context:** Many students, especially international ones, are anxious about their uncertain future (jobs, visa status) and devote their energy to temporary goals, building a "sandcastle" life that will not last. They need to be reoriented to trust God's plans and live for His kingdom instead of their own anxieties.
- **Prayer:** "Father, you are the giver of life and all good gifts. Please help students to recognise this and enjoy the gift of life, friends, study, and everything. But please let them take your word of warning to heart and not live for this life. Help them to fear you and keep your commandments. Thank you for giving us your word and Spirit to guide us. Please help FOCUS students to seek, know, and live for your will. Please grow their trust in your plans, especially when their plans seem to be failing. Please help them to desire holiness, and let their greatest longing be Jesus and for others to know Jesus."

*3. New Christian Students* 
- **Context:** The ministry is seeing new interest, with both newly arrived Christian students considering moving interstate for visa reasons and several non-Christian students like Rhys and Lucy showing openness to Jesus by attending the Bible study group. The ministry also needs a faithful, teachable group of students to form next year's committee.
- **Prayer:** "Father, please be guiding the newly arrived students to make decisions that will enable them to grow in faith, love, trust and godliness. Please provide a faithful and teachable group of students for next year's committee. Thank you for bringing Rhys and other unbelievers to Friday nights. Please work in their hearts so they'd be willing to learn more about Jesus through reading a Gospel. Please help Rhys to see the hope and love Jesus has to offer to him. Please give Lucy a curiosity to meet Jesus."

<br><br> | **Church Ministries** | <br><br> *Youth:*
Loving Lord, we place our young people into Your hands. As they take a break from school, please protect their minds, bodies, and spirits, keeping them safe from temptation and harm. May their times of rest, fun, and friendship also be filled with Your presence. Stir their hearts to draw closer to You in prayer, in reading the Bible, and through fellowship with the church. Grant them renewal and strength during this holiday so they may return ready to face the new term with faith and wisdom. Through Jesus Christ our Lord we pray, Amen.
