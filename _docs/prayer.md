## Collect
Almighty Father, whose blessed Son was revealed so that he might destroy the works of the devil and make us the children of God and heirs of eternal life: grant that having this hope we may purify ourselves as he is pure; that, when he shall appear again with power and great glory, we may be made like him in his eternal and glorious kingdom, where with you, Father, and with the Holy Spirit, he lives and reigns, one God, for evermore. Amen.

| **From the Passage** | Almighty God, our Heavenly Father, Maker of all things, seen and unseen. You are the Source of all authority and the Goal of all history. <br><br> We praise You that before the foundation of the world, You were not alone, but existed in a perfect relationship of love with Your Son and Your Spirit. We thank You that in Your freedom and goodness, You chose to create us and, even when we turned away, You graciously willed to bring us home so that You might be "all in all." <br><br> We thank You, Father, that Jesus is the "Firstfruits," the pioneer of our salvation who has conquered sin and will subdue all Your enemies. We thank You for raising Him from death for our justification. We rest in the truth that He is our Great High Priest, who took on our humanity as the Second Adam to represent us before You. We ask that as we pray, we would do so with His heart—the heart of a Son who delights to do Your will and finds His "food" in Your pleasure. <br><br> We praise You for Your Spirit, who has made these truths alive in us right now and has united us with Jesus, our Lord. We ask You that by Your grace and mercy, and through the power of Your Spirit, You may transform our "duty" into "delight," enabling us to love You as Jesus loves You. May the Spirit work in our church family to make us more like our Savior, empowering us to live for Your glory and to make Your name known in our city. Bind us together in the fellowship of the Trinity, as we look forward to the day when all creation is restored to You. <br><br> Amen.

We thank You for the beauty of this land and the resilience of its communities, and we ask for Your hand of protection and provision to rest heavily upon them. For Provision and Sustenance <br> Lord, we pray specifically for families during the dry season. For those who rely on the rains for their water and their crops, we ask that You would sustain them. Open up new sources of water and grant them a harvest that defies the dry earth. We pray for the children of Sumba, asking that they would receive the nutrition and care they need to grow strong and develop into the people You called them to be. <br><br> For Future Generations <br> We bring the youth before You. For those dreaming of a university education, please make a way where there seems to be no way. For those finishing their studies, open doors of opportunity and provide meaningful work so they can use their talents to bless their communities. <br><br> For National Stability and Safety <br> We pray for the nation of Indonesia, asking for a stable and peaceful political climate. We also lift up the caregivers who often labor in dangerous or grueling conditions; keep them safe as they sacrifice to provide for their loved ones. <br><br> For Protection from the Elements <br> Lord, shield the children, families, and staff who are constantly facing damaging weather events. In the wake of natural disasters, we ask for a special hedge of protection around the vulnerable. Protect children from the shadows of abuse and trafficking that so often follow tragedy. Let Your peace be their fortress. <br><br> Amenn |
