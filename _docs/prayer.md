General info: Berkeley Life Centre desires to see Jesus Christ transforming lives to transform a community. They minister in the south coast in an area where many people are from a low socioeconomic background. People are coming to faith and the church is making a positive impact.
- Pray for Wayne Pickford (founding pastor), who will be retiring in the middle of the year (but on long service leave from now). Pray that his health will sustain him in this role until his planned retirement
- Give thanks for Beejai Abrahams, who will join the BLC staff team as an assistant minister from Monday 20th January, 2025. Pray that he and his family can find suitable accommodation

**Church Ministries**
1. Cancare  
Heavenly Father, we praise You for Your mercy and kindness. You understand the trials and suffering we face and are compassionate toward our weaknesses. We thank You for using CanCare to support those who are battling or have overcome cancer, along with their families and friends. Through Christ’s love, they serve and walk alongside them on this challenging journey. Lord, we ask for Your continued guidance over the CanCare team in the new year. Grant them wisdom, discernment, and a spirit of unity as they care for this community. As many of CanCare’s ministries and services pause in January, we pray that You will watch over the volunteer team during this time of rest. Refresh their body, mind, and spirit, and prepare them to serve with renewed strength and energy in 2025.  

2. Evangelism Teams 
Gracious Lord, as we enter 2025, we thank You for the opportunities You have given us to proclaim Your name to those who are lost and far from You. Please continue to open our eyes to see the people You place before us, and grant us boldness and wisdom to share the mystery of the Gospel without fear. We pray that the seeds of the Gospel will be scattered and planted in good soil this year. Lord, prepare the hearts of those we encounter. Remove the barriers that hinder the Gospel, and instead, create rich, healthy soil in their hearts, ready to receive the good news of Jesus Christ. Strengthen and unite our team as we labor together for Your kingdom. May the words we speak and the lives we live reflect Your love and truth, drawing people closer to You. We pray for a fruitful year, trusting in Your power to bring the harvest.

3. Nursing Home
Dear Heavenly Father, You are the God of grace and hope. You understand every challenge and burden that each elderly person carries in their heart. We ask for Your mighty hand to touch their lives and bring comfort to their souls. Help them to turn their hearts fully to You, trust in You completely, and find true peace and blessings in Your presence. For those living in nursing homes or requiring special care at home, may they deeply experience the love of Christ surrounding them. Lord, use every member of the care and visitation team as a channel of Your love. May those they visit feel the joy and encouragement of genuine fellowship and the fullness of love shared among them.

**Groups in Church**
1. Cantonese Congregation  
Lord, we thank You for the beginning of a new year and for Your guidance and grace in the year that has passed. We pray for our brothers and sisters of the Cantonese congregation, asking for strength and wisdom as we enter this new year. Lead us to grow deeper in Christ and to know more of Your truth and love. Help us to rely on You in every challenge and opportunity, and may our lives be a testimony to Your glory. Bless our ministry teams and every brother and sister, uniting us as we serve together in all areas of ministry for the glory of Your name. In this new year, guide us to live lives that are more godly, grateful, and loving. May we support one another in Your grace, be a blessing to the church and our community, and share the Gospel wherever You lead us. Amen.

2. Volunteers 
Father God, we pray for all the volunteers serving in different ministries at St. George’s , especially for those who are new, that God would grow and equip them, and help them use their gifts to serve God and His people in 2025 and beyond. Also pray that they will feel supported, encouraged and acknowledged in their services.
