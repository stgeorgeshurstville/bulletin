[Please write your prayer around these points]
- Give thanks for the recent Christmas event hosted by Focus at Adelaide University - God provided keen student leaders to help plan the event, as well as emboldened the NTE team to write and give a talk to share from Matthew on how Jesus is God’s unexpected gift to us. Give thanks that 18 international students from different ethnic and faith backgrounds got to experience an Aussie Christmas and hear the gospel message. Pray that God will continue to open the eyes of these students that they will one day receive Jesus as their Lord and Savior. 
- Melissa is seeking to move from 4 days to 5 days on campus. Please pray for increased financial support in order to do so.

**Special Items & Events**  
From the passage: 
Heavenly Father,
We come to You with hearts that bear scars—scars of rejection, pain, and feeling left out. We acknowledge the ways fear and hurt have shaped us, teaching us to build walls, push others away, or fear rejection. Yet in Your Word, You show us Your heart—a heart that seeks the lost, rejoices over the found, and delights in showing compassion.
We thank You for Jesus, who runs after us like a shepherd after a lost sheep, who searches for us like a woman for her lost coin, and who welcomes us like a father with open arms. Help us to see ourselves through Your eyes, not as failures or outcasts, but as beloved children whom You long to embrace.
Forgive us for the ways we have contributed to the pain of others—through exclusion, judgment, or indifference. Open our eyes to those who feel invisible, our hearts to those who feel unloved, and our arms to those who need a place of belonging.
Fill our church with Your compassion, Lord. Let it overflow in healing, acceptance, and joy, so that all who come here may find a glimpse of Your kingdom—a place where every lost one is found and every wound is met with Your love.
In Jesus’ name we pray,
Amen.
