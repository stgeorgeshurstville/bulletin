| From the Passage | Heavenly Father,<br> We thank you for the truth revealed in your Word today. We thank you that you are a God of transformation, who does not work from the outside-in, but from the inside-out. We thank you for the gospel, the ultimate testament to your love, which has the power to take a heart of stone and replace it with a heart of flesh, authored by Christ and written by your Spirit.<br> Lord, we confess that we often put our trust in our own abilities and competence. We look at our own weaknesses and doubt that you could ever use us. We get frustrated and cynical when we don't see immediate results, forgetting the long, slow progress of a transformed life. Forgive us for our lack of faith in your sufficiency.<br> Now, we pray for the confidence that Paul had—not in himself, but in you. Help us to see the "living letters" around us, the work you have done in the hearts of our brothers and sisters in this church. May we value these relationships and find joy in the miraculous way you are changing lives, including our own.<br> Give us the courage to be those "incompetent mailworkers" you spoke of. Help us to drop the coin of the gospel into the lives of others, trusting that your design will ensure the outcome. Remove our fear of our own inadequacies, and fill us with your Spirit, so that we may speak the good news with confidence, knowing that you alone are the one who gives life.<br> We pray all this in the name of our competent and sufficient Savior, Jesus Christ.<br> Amen. |
| Mission & Vision | **For growing deep:** <br> Lord, plant Your Word deep in our hearts. Make us hungry for truth, eager to obey, and joyful in living it out. Shape our lives to reflect Christ, so others may see and glorify You. Amen. | 
| Global & Nation | **Government:** <br> Sovereign Lord, grant wisdom, justice, and compassion to our leaders of this nation. Guide them in truth, protect them from corruption, and stir them to serve for the good of all. May peace and righteousness flourish in our land. Amen. |

Provide for their needs, protect them from harm, and give them fruitful ministry towards the international students community in Adelaide. May their words and actions bring many to the saving knowledge of Christ. Amen. |
