**Prayer**

Lord Jesus Christ, for our sake you fasted forty days and forty nights: give us grace to use such abstinence that, our flesh being subdued to the spirit, we may always obey your will in righteousness and true holiness, to your honour and glory; for you live and reign with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God, for evermore. Amen.

**Special Items & Events**

**From the passage:**
Our heavenly Father,
Jesus defies our expectations, confronts our sin, and offends our pride. Thank You for including us in Your kingdom, where even the least among us is greater than John the Baptist, not by our merit, but by Your grace.
We confess that we often put Jesus in a box, shaping Him to fit our desires rather than surrendering to His lordship. Challenge us, Lord, to take Him on His terms, to be transformed by His truth, and to conform to His likeness by the power of Your Spirit.
When people are scandalised by Christ in us, help us not to fear but to count it a blessing. Give us courage to point to Jesus in everything we do—in our words, thoughts, and deeds, everywhere, to everyone, and all the time. May our lives reflect His glory, even when it costs us.
In Jesus’ name,
Amen.
