Almighty God, you have poured upon us the new light of your incarnate Word: Grant that this light, enkindled in our hearts, may shine forth in our lives; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.

| **From the Passage** | Gracious and holy Father,<br><br> We come before You this Christmas in a world filled with darkness—  violence, fear, grief, and sin that we cannot fix or escape.<br><br> We thank You for Your Servant, the One You chose, upheld, and exalted—  the One who bore our griefs and carried our sorrows,  who was pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities.<br><br> We all, like sheep, have gone astray.  We have wandered in pride, fear, and self-righteousness into idolatry and sin.<br><br> Yet You laid our sin on Your Servant,  and through His wounds we are healed.<br><br> Thank You that in Him justice is satisfied  and mercy is poured out—  that the guilty are forgiven  and the broken are restored.<br><br> Lift our eyes to see the splendour of Your Servant.  Clear our guilt, quiet our fear, and assure us of our peace with You.<br><br> Shape us to be servant-hearted people, willing to step into the darkness,  to stand in the breach,  and to bear witness to the grace we have receive that others winners may experience your grace in Jesus..<br><br> We pray in the name of Jesus Christ,  the Servant who was despised,  now exalted,  and worshipped by all nations. Amen. <br><br> **Amen**.|

As of a few months ago, Phil and Lil had to come back to Australia but are still working remotely as they continue this work. Here are their latest prayer points for November and December: <br><br>**Praise God:** Lil had an encouraging time at the prayer conference in Indonesia last month. It was a great time of fellowship, networking, and intercession for the M world. Lil was also encouraged by the opportunity to share some of the materials she wrote and to share how she prays for "countries at war" in one of the workshops. <br><br>**Courier Issues:** When we left West Asia, we sent several boxes of books, clothes, and toys by courier. Two boxes still have not arrived due to a dispute between the courier and their local contact. Ask that the problem would be resolved and the boxes delivered soon. <br><br>**Translation Project:** Ask that the Greek Interlinear New Testament team would continue to work well, and that the Lord would guide Phil and the team in their decisions as they check different books. Phil will travel to meet with them from 12–17 January. Ask that these meetings would be effective in moving the project toward completion. <br><br>**Family Transitions:** Ask that Susannah and Joanna would have a good break before school starts and settle into their new school well.| 
| **Church Ministries** |*CanCare* <br><br> Heavenly Father, we praise You for Your mercy and kindness. You understand the trials and suffering we face and are compassionate toward our weaknesses. We thank You for raising up CanCare Centre to support those who are currently battling or have overcome cancer, along with their families and friends. Through Christ’s love, they serve and walk alongside them on this challenging journey. As 2025 draws to a close, we are grateful for how You have supported the various ministries of CanCare Centre through a team of dedicated volunteers, prayer warriors, and friends who have quietly provided financial support. May You personally remember and reward their selfless dedication andloving contributions. During this summer break, we pray that You grant them ample rest and spiritual renewal, so that in the coming year, they may continue to shine for You in their respective roles, accompanying those battling cancer with the love of Christ as they walk this journey together. <br><br> *Nursing home / Pastoral Care Teams* <br><br> Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You for watching over every elderly person throughout this past year with Your grace and hope. You know the burdens and needs in each of their hearts. We ask that You continue to comfort them by Your mighty hand and help them to fix their eyes on You alone, finding true peace and blessing in Your presence. Whether they are living in nursing homes or receiving special care at home, may they experience more deeply Your love and abiding presence in their daily lives. Lord, we also thank You for using every member involved in care and visitation ministry throughout this year. Please continue to use them as channels of Your love. Through each visit, moment of companionship, and act of care, may those who are visited experience the joy of fellowship, the warmth of being remembered, and the hope that comes from You. As we look ahead, we pray that You would continue to guide this ministry. Grant strength, compassion, and wisdom, so that all our service may glorify Your name and become a blessing in the lives of the elderly.|
