## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** Grant us, Lord, we pray, the spirit to think and do always such things as are right, that we who cannot do anything that is good without you, may in your strength be able to live according to your will; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Dear God, our loving and kind Father, you are full of grace and patience, and you always love us. You are holy and fair, but you never turn away from those who look for you. We feel safe and comforted with you, our God. We trust you with our lives and know your love never fails. As we come to you through Jesus, we ask for your mercy and help with everything we need. Let your Spirit work in us to grow love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
- **Growing Out**: Our gracious Father, thank you that the Gospel is the power of salvation to all people. Thank you that even now the Gospel has come to us, it is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world. We pray that many in our generation will hear and truly understand your grace. Please help us to be godly in life, resilient in ministry, servant-hearted, Biblical in life, thought and ministry, and able to love and minister faithfully, compassionately and effectively in different and changing contexts, cooperating with one another, humble, wise, prayerful, reflective, energetic and effective. Please help us to take our faith in Jesus beyond the walls of the church into our workplace, school, where we live and where we holiday. Please help us to have a compassion for the lost like Jesus. Please help us to be willing to go into the world, to be interested in the lives of people we meet. Please give us opportunities to represent Jesus and to speak of Him. Please give us the words to say. Please save our neighbours through us.
- **Sermon**: We are sorry for not being more thankful and instead spending so much time complaining and just asking for things. We are sorry for not seeing your continual work in people and the world. We praise you for the gospel which gives us a certain hope of heaven because of what Jesus has done. May we grow in our faith in Christ and love of people. May we think of ourselves as servants and be faithful as we share the message and see it bear fruit. May we at all times and in all places be thankful of your work in Christians. May our faith and love keep growing.

## Mission Partner Focus
- **Phil and Lil in West Asia:** Father God, we realise that all flesh is like grass yet your word remains forever. May the gospel keep bearing fruit around the world including in West Asia as it grows our hope in heaven, faith in Jesus and love for all people. We praise you for allowing Phil, Lil, Susannah and Joanna to be in West Asia over the last 13 years. May you grow their faith, godliness and service. Give Phil wisdom to help the locals translate the Bible into their heart language, trains leaders and teaches in the Bible College. Allow Lil to disciple the local women and guidance in her role as the Prayer Strategy Coordinator. May their visa extension be granted soon, Phil’s frozen shoulder heal quickly and there will be enough electricity for everyone in the city.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Government:** You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May they enact laws and initiatives so that the orphans, widows and harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit to their authority as we hold out the word of life and ultimately submit to you as we love you and our neighbour. 
- **Children:** Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow their hearts to love Jesus and become more like Him each day. Give strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to genuinely love the kids and show them Jesus.
- **Youth**: Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength and security in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness and at times feelings of hopelessness. May we be a safe and respectful environment where youths can explore their questions and find true meaning. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities and temptations. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness. May they have a secure attachment to Jesus especially as we go through different beliefs and behaviours that may draw us away such as materialism, expressive individualism and hedonism. May we be a church family who are joyful and godly witnesses as we aim to be transformed together and represent Jesus.
- **SRE:** Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus in our local public school. May we never take this for granted. Give our combined Christian teacher team (Lam, Carol, George, Fiona, Alice, Tracey, Glorya, Fiona, and Felishia) strength to keep teaching and witnessing faithfully.
- **Mandarin Congregation:**  Praise God for the 8 people who have recently committed their lives to Christ after attending our Investigating Christianity/Gospel classes. Please pray that they may be faithfully followed up and grounded in their faith through our Just for Starters class.
