## Week 4 (Fourth Sunday of the month)

| From the Passage | You are rich in mercy. You have loved us with a measureless love in Jesus. Thank you that we have come to know this love through your Word—the message of the gospel. Thank you for its sufficiency and power: able to give life, shape minds, and nourish our souls. Thank you that the Word which gave us life can give life to others. And thank you that you allow us the privilege of bringing this Word to others. We know that your church is in constant danger—from within and without. Threatened by the patterns of worldly thinking, by error, falsehood, hypocrisy and by the schemes and deception of our Enemy. Yet you do not leave us unprotected. Thank you that you are at work by your Spirit, through your Word, to guard and keep your flock. Thank you for giving your church the gift of pastors, teachers, evangelists, parents, and spiritual aunties and uncles. Keep us from treating ministry as a duty, performance, or just a rostered task. Help us to see it instead as part of our faith-filled response to your mercy—worship that consumes our whole lives. May we be continually shaped by your Word. Let all that we do—corporately and individually—be in conformity with sound doctrine. May your Word ring out from St George’s with clarity and conviction. Help us give ourselves fully to this Word through lives of godliness. May we pay close attention to both our life and our doctrine. We pray especially for those given the task of leadership: May their progress in Christ be evident. And may your people look to these examples and follow them—as our leaders follow Christ.In the name of Jesus, our Saviour, Shepherd, and Teacher—Amen.|
| Mission & Vision | **For Growing Deep**<br>Father, help us grow deeper in our relationship with You. Give us a hunger for Your Word, a heart of prayer, and a life of obedience. May our faith mature as we walk closely with Jesus each day. Amen | 
| Global & Nation | **Government**<br>Lord of all governments, we thank You for the governance of Australia. Bless our leaders with wisdom, guide our people in justice and peace, and help us to be a nation that serves you accordingly. Amen |
| Mission Partners  | **Mathys and PNG**<br>General info: There are >800 languages spoken in Papua New Guinea, but only 13 have complete bibles. Calvin and Ruth work alongside Papua New Guineans in roles that support the ongoing ministry of bible translation. Calvin is an aircraft maintenance engineer, in order to provide transport and logistics support for bible translators. Ruth provides training for the bible translators, so that locals can take the lead in this work. [Summary of March 2025 newsletter, however await their live updates on the day!] Currently on home assignment in Melbourne. Give thanks for being able to enjoy a family holiday. Pray for them as they present and speak at churches. Pray for God to continue providing financial partnerships as they determine a new field budget and aim to return to PNG in July. Pray that they can trust God to be content and be good stewards of his generous provision. Pray for their children (Jakob as he settles into new student accommodation, and for Andreas/Petra as they continue schooling online) |
| Church Ministries | **Evangelism teams**:<br> A prayer for the church plant into HPS: Heavenly Father, We come before You with hearts full of gratitude, thanking You for hearing our prayers and opening the door for us to serve our neighbours through Hurstville Public School. You are the God who makes a way where there seems to be none, and we praise You for this opportunity to share Your love and truth with the school community. Lord, we lift up this new ministry to You. We ask for Your guidance in every logistical and practical detail—smooth transitions, clear communication, willing volunteers, and the resources we need to serve faithfully. Calm the fears of those who are anxious, and fill us all with Your peace that surpasses understanding. Above all, Father, align our hearts with Your will. We know Your heart beats for the salvation of sinners—for the lost to be sought and found. May Your name be hallowed in our words, our lives, our thoughts, and our relationships. Let Your kingdom come in our midst as we reflect the glory of Jesus, shining as a light to the school community and beyond. Grant us wisdom to love well, courage to speak truth with grace, and humility to depend on You in all things. May everything we do point others to Christ, the hope of the world. In Jesus’ name, Amen. |
