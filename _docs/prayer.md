## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
  
- **Collect**: Lord God, you declare your almighty power chiefly in showing mercy and pity: grant us such a measure of your grace that, running in the way of your commandments, we may obtain your promises, and share in your heavenly treasure; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
  
- **Growing Deep**: Oh Lord, how We love your law! Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path. Thank you that Jesus has give us the Word of Eternal Life. Thank you that heaven and earth may pass away but our Lord’s words will never pass away. Please help us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds by your Word. Please help us to deepen our understanding of and obedience to your Word. 
  
- **Church Sermon:** Almighty and most merciful, our hearts are broken by our sin. WE have walked away from you like lost sheep. We have followed too much the ways of the world and the desires of our hearts. We have done what we ought not to have done, and we have left undone what we ought to have done. We grieve that the world is blaspheming against you because of us. Have mercy on us. Have mercy on your church. Forgive us according to your promises made in Jesus. Empower us by your Spirit to live godly and righteous lives that the world may give glory to you. Amen.

## Mission Partners
- **Berkeley Life Centre:** Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain times and places so that they may find you. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast their burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. May people who are suffering from domestic violence, dealing with the police and justice system, suffering from mental illness, experiencing difficult and dysfunctional relationships and navigating health issues will know that Jesus has come for the sinners and to seek and save the lost. Please sustain Rev. Wayne Pickford and the team as they lead the church to be a light and witness in their community. We praise you for providing Samantha Trotter who will help with the womens and children ministry later in the year.
- **JC in SE Asia**: You call us to make and mature disciples of all nations. We ask that you’ll allow JC to courageously, lovingly and prayerfully share the gospel in a country where evangelism is not allowed and even publicly practicing one’s faith is difficult. May you protect them during this period when the authorities are clamping down on religious activities. May you soften the hearts of the authorities and the people so that they’ll hear and accept the peace, purpose and real spiritual prosperity in Jesus. May you raise up Christians and leaders in the university and church.

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Government**: You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May they enact laws and initiatives so that the orphans, widows and harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit to their authority as we hold out the word of life and ultimately submit to you.
  
- **Children**: Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow in their hearts a love and desire for Jesus and God’s Word. Give strength to parents to discipline their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to genuinely love the kids. 

- **Youth**: Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength and security in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness and at times feelings of hopelessness. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities and temptations. May our youths be respectful with their words and actions. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness. May we be a church family who are joyful and godly witnesses as we aim to be transformed together and represent Jesus especially as we look at Christian truths that change lives this term.  

- **SRE**: Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus in our local public school. May we never take this for granted. Give our combined Christian teacher team (Lam, Carol, George, Alice, Tracey, Glorya, Fiona, and Andrew) strength to keep teaching and witnessing faithfully. 

- **Mandarin Congregation**: Lord, we pray for the Gospel class after service that people will know Jesus. Not just intellectual knowledge, but reflecting their own life so that Jesus becomes their personal saviour. We pray for the Gospel class after Wednesday English class in June that students will hear the Gospel in their own language. Through the simple form of three word Gospel, and discussion questions, they will see that Gospel is relevant, and believable. We pray for the new Mandarin pastor that he and his congregation will have a smooth transition to our church.
