## Week B


**From the Passage**
<br><br> Gracious God,

 We praise you for Jesus — the light who shines in the darkness.
 When the world was lost and blind, you sent your Son,  the Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.  He is the hope,the joy, the peace, the life of the world.

Thank you that through him, the light has dawned —  that even in our darkest days, your promises still stand.

Thank you that Jesus bore the burden of guilt and shame on the cross,
 so that we might walk free in the light of your grace.
And now, Lord, make us your light-bearers.  As Ephesians says, once we were darkness,
 but now we are light in the Lord.

Help us to live as children of light — to reflect the goodness, righteousness, and truth of Christ in our homes, our schools, our workplaces, and our city.

May others see your light in us and be drawn to Jesus,  the child who became our Saviour, the King whose peace will never end.

We pray this in his powerful name,

Amen.

**Mission Partners**
<br><br>*Persecuted Christians*   

<br><br>*JC in SE Asia*   
Sovereign God, we come before you now to lift up our mission partner, JC, who serves you so faithfully in a place of great challenge and risk.

We thank you for the sheer boldness and constancy of his witness—that he shines for Jesus anyplace and anytime. Thank you for his heart, his dedication, and the incredible work you are accomplishing through him and his team.

We thank you that as a church we were able to hear more about his story and be encouraged as he is not ashamed of the gospel . We pray for a powerful shield of protection over JC guarding his movements, his health, and his communications. May his faith remain strong and his steps be guided by your Spirit.

Specifically, we bring before you the grave and tense situation resulting from the arrest of the seven leaders from that influential house group for "illegal religious activity” that happened recently.  We pray for their immediate safety, justice, and release. Give them endurance, wisdom in their answers, and a profound sense of peace while they are detained. Let this hardship not break their faith, but instead be a testimony to the strength of Christ within them.

For the house churches they served, we ask that you pour out a spirit of peace, not paralyzing fear. May the remaining believers be strengthened to maintain fellowship and continue their worship in secret. Turn this tense situation into an opportunity, and let the Gospel continue to spread to others, multiplied by the very pressure it faces.


**Church Ministries**
<br><br> *CanCare*  
Heavenly Father, we praise You for Your mercy and kindness. You understand the trials and suffering we face and are compassionate toward our weaknesses. We thank You for using CanCare to support those who are battling or have overcome cancer, along with their families and friends. Through Christ’s love, they serve and walk alongside them on this challenging journey.

As the year draws to a close and we prepare to celebrate the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, we pray for Your blessing upon CanCare’s ministries during this joyful season. May every service and special Christmas program become a channel of grace, sharing the good news that Jesus came into the world to save mankind. We pray that every patient and family will receive this priceless gift of salvation and be renewed with hope and joy in life.

<br><br> *Nursing home / Pastoral Care Teams*  
Dear Heavenly Father, You are the God of grace and hope. You know the unique struggles and hardships each elderly person carries in their heart. We ask that Your mighty hand would touch their hearts and bring comfort to their spirits. Help them to lift their eyes to You alone and to rely on You, that they may receive true peace and blessing in Your presence. Whether they are living in nursing homes or receiving special care at home, Lord, may they experience Your love in a deeper way. 

We also pray that You would use every member of the care and visitation team as a channel of Your love. May those they visit feel the joy and encouragement of genuine fellowship and the fullness of love shared among them.
