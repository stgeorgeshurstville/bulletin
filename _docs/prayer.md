## Collect
Almighty God, we confess that we have no power of ourselves to help ourselves: keep us outwardly in our bodies and inwardly in our souls, that we may be defended from all activities that may happen to the body, and from all evil thoughts that may assault and hurt the soul; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

| **From the Passage** | Father, thank you for who you are. Thank you for who the Son is, who the Holy Spirit is. Thank you that your inexhaustible, eternal life is lived out in the unity of the Trinity, in the Trinity of the unity. Lord, thank you for sending your Son. Thank you for sending the Holy Spirit. Thank you that the Holy Spirit is sent to strengthen us in our inner man, so that we can understand the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge. It's in the name of Jesus Christ that we pray this. Amen.|

| **Mission Partners** | **Berkley Life Centre** <br><br> *General info: Berkeley Life Centre desires to see Jesus Christ transforming lives to transform a community. They minister in the south coast in an area where many people are from a low socioeconomic background. People are coming to faith and the church is making a positive impact.* <br><br> Heavenly Father, we lift up the Berkeley Life Centre and the vital work being done in Your name. We thank You for the mission You have placed on this community: to pray, to depend entirely on You, and to proclaim the Gospel throughout Berkeley. <br><br> Lord, we ask for Your blessing on the outreach to the growing Muslim community and all the people of Berkeley. May every interaction be seasoned with grace as the team seeks to share the good news of Jesus with their neighbors. <br><br> We pray for the spiritual growth of the BLC family. Strengthen their 1:1 discipling and relationship-building, that members would truly become disciples who make disciples. Help each person to grow into a more Christlike version of themselves through Your Spirit. <br><br> We thank You for the Op Shop and the practical care it provides. We pray for the team of Christian volunteers—keep them strong, well-supported, and unified in their ministry as they provide clothing and food through partners like Anglicare. <br><br> As the Men’s and Women’s Ministries are upgraded, we ask for Your favor on the upcoming self-improvement courses. Transform lives, Lord; help participants become better partners, parents, and community members. We specifically ask for Your breakthrough where there is resistance to change; soften hearts and help people trade old behaviors for the new life found in You. <br><br> Finally, Lord, we ask that You would send more Christian volunteers to join this mission. We trust that under Your leadership, these goals will be achieved for Your glory. <br><br> In the name of Jesus, Amen|
| **Church Ministries** | **EAL/D** <br><br> Heavenly Father, <br><br> We come before You with grateful hearts, thanking You for the growth of the Everyday English Ministry. We praise You for the **12 new students** who have registered for our beginner class; thank You for bringing them into our community. We specifically lift up our **Spanish and Nepalese speakers**, asking that they would feel a deep sense of belonging and peace within our walls. <br><br> Lord, we give You great thanks for our **hardworking teachers**. We see the immense effort and heart they pour into every lesson plan and every interaction. Please sustain their energy and fill them with Your wisdom as they teach. <br><br> Ultimately, Lord, we ask that You would be so kind as to use these English lessons to bridge the gap of communication. We pray that as language is learned, the greatest news of all would be shared. Open doors for us to clearly communicate the need for every person to know Jesus, so that through these classes, hearts may be drawn to You. <br><br> In Jesus’ name, Amen. <br><br> **Redevelopmenet**  <br><br> The next stop in the redevelopmenet is in the opening of the HAFF application in March. In the meantime, the challenge and call to the whole church is to be mission and ministry ready with our stewardship.|
