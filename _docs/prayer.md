**Prayer**

Almighty and everlasting God, in tender love towards mankind you sent your Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ, to take our nature upon him and to suffer death on the cross, that all mankind should follow the example of his great humility: grant that we may follow the example of his suffering, and also be made partakers of his resurrection; through him who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever. Amen.



## Week 4 (Fourth Sunday of the month)

### From the passage ###
**From Matthew 13:**

Heavenly Father,
Father, we see the stark contrast between the kingdom of this world and the kingdom of heaven. In the world, the powerful seek to control, to take, and to destroy. But in Your kingdom, the King comes to serve, to provide, and to save. The world feasts in self-indulgence, but You prepare a banquet of life. Teach us to trust in You, to lay aside all that is worthless, and to take hold of what is truly priceless—the kingdom of heaven, where You reign in justice, mercy, and love.

Lord, you are the great ‘I am’, who have walked on the waves to save His people from the greatest of all our enemies, sin and judgment, and in whom there is no fear. 
We are weak, but You are strong. We are fearful, but You are our peace. We waver, but You hold us fast. Teach us to reach out our hands to You, to trust not in our own strength but in Your saving power. And may our lives reflect the truth that Jesus is Lord, the King who reigns not in cruelty but in compassion, not in arrogance but in grace.

We confess that like Peter— we are often quick to step out in faith but just as quick to falter when we see the wind and the waves. Forgive us for when we doubt Your power, Your goodness, and Your love. Help us to lift our eyes and fix them on Your Son, our Saviour, our King, our ever-present help in trouble.
We lift up to You those who are in the midst of suffering. Lord, You are the God who provides, who protects, and who saves. We ask for comfort beyond what human hands can give, for strength that only comes from Your Spirit, and for the deep assurance that in Jesus, death is not the end.

In Jesus’ name, we pray,
Amen.

### Special items & events ###
Heavenly Father,

You are our strong tower, and to You all things in heaven and earth will bow. Be the refuge and defence of Jeremy’s family—his widow, Amelia; his mother, Rowena; his grandmother, Betty; his father, Edwin; his brother, Ashley; and all who loved him. May they find comfort, consolation, and hope in our Lord Jesus, whom You have raised from the dead, knowing that those who are in Him will also be raised.  

We give thanks for Jeremy’s life, and in faith and trust, we commend him into Your keeping, praying that in Your good purposes, we may one day rejoice with him in Your eternal kingdom. Kindle our hope, and let our grief give way to the joy of Your promises.  

We pray this in the name of Jesus, who was dead but is now alive.  

Amen.
