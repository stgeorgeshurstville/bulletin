We ask this for the communication, vestry, cleaning, flower, bulletin, meals, tea, AV, sound, technology, repair & maintenance, and other teams.

May they grow in their knowledge of your love for them and continue to speak the truth in love to their community. We praise you for how people have responded as they preached the gospel at Hurstville train station each Monday. We pray that through their ministry, many more Nepalese would come to know and serve the Lord Jesus Christ.

Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
