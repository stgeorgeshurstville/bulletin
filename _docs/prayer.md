| From the Passage | Heavenly Father,<br>You are the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort.<br>We thank You that You meet us not in our strength,<br>but in our weakness.<br>Not when we have it all together,<br>but when we have come to the end of ourselves.<br>In seasons of affliction,<br>when we are pressed beyond what we can bear,<br>teach us again to rely not on ourselves,<br>but on You—the God who raises the dead.<br>Thank You for the comfort You give<br>through Christ who suffered for us and with us.<br>Make us vessels of that same comfort to others,<br>so that in our pain, Your mercy might be known.<br>As we step into this new season as a church—<br>with change, with uncertainty, with hope—<br>anchor us not in buildings or plans,<br>but in the unshakable grace of Christ our Lord.<br>In His name we pray,<br>Amen. |

| Church Ministries | **CanCare** <br>Heavenly Father, we praise You for Your mercy and kindness. You understand the trials and suffering we face and are compassionate toward our weaknesses. We thank You for using CanCare to support those who are battling or have overcome cancer, along with their families and friends. Through Christ’s love, they serve and walk alongside them on this challenging journey. We are grateful that the 18th Anniversary CanCare Dinner held on June 22 was able to take place smoothly. Lord, we ask You to remember the 500+ friends who attended that evening, as well as those who could not attend but have faithfully supported CanCare behind the scenes over the years. May their contributions continue to sustain and strengthen CanCare in the year ahead, bringing even more blessings and care to cancer patients and their families. <br> <br> **Nursing home / Pastoral Care Teams** <br> Dear Heavenly Father, You are the God of grace and hope. You understand every challenge and burden that each elderly person carries in their heart. We ask for Your mighty hand to touch their lives and bring comfort to their souls. Help them to turn their hearts fully to You, trust in You completely, and find true peace and blessings in Your presence. For those living in nursing homes or requiring special care at home, may they deeply experience the love of Christ surrounding them. Lord, use every member of the care and visitation team as a channel of Your love. May those they visit feel the joy and encouragement of genuine fellowship and the fullness of love shared among them. |

|Special Items & Events | **Thanksgiving Prayer for the 30th Anniversary of the Chinese Ministry**<br> Almighty God and our gracious Father,<br> With hearts full of thanksgiving, we praise You for 30 years of Your grace and faithfulness upon the Chinese ministry of our church. From the vision first planted within the English congregation, You brought forth the Chinese ministry. From a small group of believers in the Chinese congregation worshipping together, You have grown this ministry in Your perfect timing, and later also brought forth the starting of Cantonese and Mandarin congregations, each step marked by Your provision and mercy.<br>We thank You for the lives transformed, the gospel proclaimed, the families built up, and the unity shared across languages and cultures. We thank You for raising up leaders and faithful servants, and for guiding us through seasons of challenge and growth. We especially give thanks for the new beginnings You have granted through the Nepali ministry. In all of this, we see Your generous hand at work, and to You alone we give all glory.<br>As we reflect on the past, we also look to the future with faith and hope. May You continue to strengthen and grow the English, Chinese, and Nepali ministries of this church. Unite us in heart and purpose to proclaim Christ, build up His church, and serve our communities with compassion and truth.<br>Lord, may this anniversary stir in us deeper gratitude, renewed commitment, and greater love for You and for one another. Help us live out this year’s vision: “Shine for Christ – Everywhere, Anytime.” May we be a church that carries the light of Jesus into every corner of life, and may many come to know Him through our witness.<br>In His glorious name we pray, Amen. |
