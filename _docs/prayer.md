## Sunday Prayer Points


- **Collect:** God our Father, you have prepared for those who love you such good things as pass manâ€™s understanding: pour into our hearts such love towards you, that we, loving you above all things, may obtain your promises which exceed all that we can desire; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Vision 2024 - Secure Attachment to Jesus:** Dear God, our loving and kind Father, you are full of grace and patience, and you always love us. You are holy and fair, but you never turn away from those who look for you. We feel safe and comforted with you, our God. We trust you with our lives and know your love never fails. As we come to you through Jesus, we ask for your mercy and help with everything we need. Let your Spirit work in us to grow love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
- **Mission:** Dear God, our loving Father, thank you for letting us be part of your plan. Thank you for letting us make a difference in the world. We ask that you help the people around us to know Jesus and become more like him. Please use us to teach others about you and to love our neighbors. Help us to do things that honor you, and not just take, but give and help in the ways you want us to.
- **Sermon:** We are sorry for when we are attached to idols. We praise you that Jesus is God, humble and exalted. May we know this more and more and have a secure attachment to him. May this change how we think, feel and act including how we consider others more significant than ourselves.
