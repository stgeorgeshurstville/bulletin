| From the Passage | Heavenly Father, We bow before You, the God from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name. We thank You for Your mercy—so rich, so undeserved—that You have poured out on us through Jesus Christ. You have not treated us as we deserve. You have not measured us by our usefulness or success, but by the infinite worth of Your Son who gave Himself for us. And in Him, You have declared us loved, forgiven, and chosen. Strengthen us now, we pray, with power through Your Spirit in our inner being, so that Christ may dwell in our hearts through faith.
 Root us and ground us in love—not the self-seeking love of this world, but the self-giving love of Christ who gave all of Himself as a living sacrifice. Help us see with new eyes what true worship is: Not just a song we sing, or a service we attend, but a whole life laid down, joyfully and freely, in view of Your mercy. Forgive us, Lord, when we’ve thought of ministry as a burden, a payment, or a way to prove ourselves. Remind us again that we serve not to earn Your love, but because we are already so deeply loved. Help us see that in Your kingdom, even the weakest member is of immeasurable value. Renew our minds, reshape our hearts, and conform our lives to the pattern of Christ. And may we, together as Your church, grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ. May we know and testify this love that surpasses knowledge, that we may be filled to the measure of all Your fullness.In Jesus' name we pray, Amen. |
