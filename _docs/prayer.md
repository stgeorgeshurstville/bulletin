- **Lord’s Prayer**: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.

- **Collect**: Almighty God, you have given us your only Son to take our nature upon him and as at this time to be born of a pure virgin: grant that we, being born again and made your children by adoption and grace, may daily be renewed by your Holy Spirit; through our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.
  
- **Growing Out:** Our gracious Father, thank you that the Gospel is the power of salvation to all people. Thank you that even now the just has the Gospel has come to us, it is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world. We pray that many in our generation will hear and truly understand you grace.

Please help us to take our faith in Jesus beyond the walls of the church into our workplace, school, where we live and where we holiday. Please help us to have compassion for the lost like Jesus. Please help us to be willing to go into the world, to be interested in the lives of people we meet. Please give us opportunities to represent Jesus and to speak of Him. Please give us the words to say. Please save our neighbours through us.



- **Church Sermon**:
  
Have mercy on us, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out our transgressions.
 _Wash us thoroughly from our iniquity, and cleanse us from our sin! For we know our transgressions, and our sin is ever before us._
 
 Against you, you only, have we sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgement.
 
 _Hide your face from our sins, and blot out all our iniquities._
 
 Create in us a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within us.
 
 _Cast us not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from us._
 
 Restore to us the joy of your salvation, and uphold us with a willing spirit.
 
 _For you will not delight in sacrifice, or we would give it;_
 
 you will not be pleased with a burnt offering.
 
 _Our sacrifice, O God, is a broken spirit;_
 
 a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.

Thank you for the coming of your Messiah, our Saviour. Thank you that he has taken up our pain and boren our transgressions, that he was pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities. Thank you that the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. 
We pray that by the power of your Spirit, we will live lives worthy of our Lord. We long for the world to come to your Rest, and that the world will know you. We praise you for your patience. We pray that the Word of our Saviour will go out into all the world through your people that all may know You and your justice and mercy. In the name of your Son. 
 Amen.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Government**: You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May they enact laws and initiatives so that the orphans, widows and harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit to their authority as we hold out the word of life and ultimately submit to you.

- **Children**: Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow in their hearts a love and desire for Jesus and God’s Word. Give strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to genuinely love the kids. 

- **Youth**: Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength and security in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness and at times feelings of hopelessness. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities and temptations. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness. May we be a church family who are joyful and godly witnesses as we aim to be transformed together and represent Jesus.

- **SRE**: Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus in our local public school. May we never take this for granted. Give our combined Christian teacher team (Lam, Carol, George, Alice, Tracey, Glorya, Fiona, and Andrew) rest over the holidays and please raise up more workers for the harvest field.
  
- **Mandarin Congregation**: Lord, we thank you for the number of brothers and sisters at the 11am and 4pm Mandarin congregations who are getting baptised this Sunday. We praise you for saving them in Christ and we pray that  Christ and pray that their love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ--to the glory and praise of God.
We pray for the Christmas Celebration of our Mandarin congregations at 4pm next Sunday, that in your mercy you may bring many non-Christians to come and hear the good news of Jesus. We pray that there may be lots of good gospel conversations after. We pray for the follow-up team that they may help the non-Christians to investigate further the truth of Christianity and follow-up those who have committed to following Jesus.
