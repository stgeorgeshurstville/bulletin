## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer**: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.

- **Collect**: Almighty Father, whose Son was revealed in majesty before he suffered death upon the cross: give us grace to perceive his glory, that we may be strengthened to suffer with him and be changed into his likeness, from glory to glory; who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.

- **Growing Up**: Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day.

- **Church Sermon**: We are sorry for when we pray for our own priorities and that our own names may be glorified. We thank you for Jesus who allows us to call his Father our Father. May we together desire the Father’s name to be hallowed. Amen. 

## Weekly Prayer Points

- **Berkley Life Centre**: Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain times and places so that they may find you. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast their burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley (where many are from a low socioeconomic background and struggling with rising cost of living) will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. May people who are suffering from domestic violence, dealing with the police and justice system, suffering from mental illness, experiencing difficult and dysfunctional relationships and navigating health issues will know that Jesus has to seek and save the lost. Please sustain Rev. Wayne Pickford and the team as they lead the church to be a light and witness in their community. We praise you for providing Samantha Trotter who is helping with the womens and children ministry and that she is settling well into the church and community. Pray for enough money to be raised to buy the building where the Op Shop is. May the Frozen Meals and Monthly BBQ Ministries be an avenue for the church to connect with others, care for those who are struggling and hear the good news. May Glenn grow in his conviction, character and competence as he continues The Well Training Program.

- **Empowering Everyone with English in Jesus' Name**: We praise you for the many people groups that are in Hurstville including members from Nepal, Latin America, Mongolia, Philippines and China. May we have a heart for them to settle and live well in Australia and more importantly to find their true residence in Heaven. May the teachers and volunteers be a model of love and good works as they teach people about Jesus and English. May the ministry go well as it starts up again. May you raise up godly and gifted teachers who have a heart for this ministry and the people.

- **CanCare**: Father God, we thank you that you know what it means to face trials and pain and that you can sympathise with our weaknesses. We thank you for using CanCare to support people and their family and friends who are or have suffered from the pain of cancer. May God bless those suffering from cancer with His peace. May God's salvation come to those who have yet to accept Jesus. We ask you to grant wisdom to the CanCare management team, coordinators, and volunteers to overcome all the challenges of the ministries that they may face in 2024. While doing so, help them to bear the fruit of the Spirit so that they may draw people to Christ through their good deeds and words.

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Nursing Homes and Seniors Ministries**: We thank you Father, that our hope in Jesus cannot be taken from us. We remember those who are living in residential care, those who are living at home and receiving care, those who are providing the care, and their families. We pray for safety and comfort for the aged. We pray for protection for the carers, workers and volunteers from sickness and other dangers. We pray that all will hear and experience the love and peace of Christ.

- **Cantonese Congregations**: Lord, we place our brothers and sisters of the Cantonese congregation in Your care. Please guide them to actively seek truth and keep walking in Your ways. Bless our pastoral work, enabling us to unite and build strong relationships. Strengthen our discipleship group ministry, expanding networks and offering more care and support. Help leaders who care for congregational growth, inspiring more willing individuals to serve together, granting them wisdom and joy. Help us, Lord, to live out the mission of glorifying God, loving neighbors, and making disciples, demonstrating Your love to establish a stronger, more loving spiritual family and impact our community. Amen.
