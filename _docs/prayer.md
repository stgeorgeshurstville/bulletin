## Collect
"Almighty and everlasting God, you are always more ready to hear than we to pray, and constantly give more than either we desire or deserve: pour down on us the abundance of your mercy, forgiving us those things of which our conscience is afraid, and giving us those good things which we are not worthy to ask, except through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ, your Son our Lord. Amen."

| From the Passage | Gracious God,<br><br>In Your mercy You have given us the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br>In Your mercy You open blind eyes.<br>In Your mercy You have entrusted us, Your servants, with the glorious ministry of the gospel.<br>As we face disappointment, rejection, conflict, or weakness, we are tempted to lose heart.<br>We are tempted to distort Your word, to glorify ourselves, and to make life and ministry about us.<br>Forgive us.<br>By the power of the gospel, guard our hearts when such temptations come.<br>By Your mercy, open our eyes to Your power, and by Your Spirit turn our trust back to You.<br>Lord Jesus, help us to live and speak with integrity, setting forth the truth plainly, so that others may see You and not us.<br>Give us courage not to hide the gospel,and humility to serve as slaves for Your sake.<br>For those among us today who are still unsure about You, we pray that You would open blind eyes and soften hearts.<br>Shine the light of Christ into their lives, that they may see Your mercy and know Your saving love.<br>We pray all this through Jesus Christ our Lord, the light of the world.<br>Amen.|
