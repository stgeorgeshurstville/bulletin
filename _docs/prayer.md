## Collect
Almighty God, the protector of all who put their trust in you, without whom nothing is strong, nothing is holy: increase and multiply upon us your mercy, so that with you as our ruler and guide, we may so pass through things temporal that we finally lose not the things eternal; grant this, heavenly Father, for our Lord Jesus Christ’s sake. Amen.

| From the Passage |Gracious God, <br> We thank You for calling us into Your family through the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. Though we were once enslaved by sin, You have saved us, freed us, and repurposed us for Your service. You have made us one body, united by one Lord, in one Spirit. Help us to live worthy of this calling. Forgive us, Lord, that we have often based our relationships on things other than the Gospel. Forgive our pride, our impatience, our selfishness, and our lack of love. Where there has been gossip or factions, restore peace. Where there is hurt or misunderstanding, bring healing. Where there’s avoidance, bring clarity and encourage. Make us eager to maintain and express the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Shape us, Lord, to be a mature church—humble, gentle, patient, bearing with one another in love.Thank You for giving our church teachers and pastors. Please help them to be faithful in their calling. Help us each to play our part in the body— to take your Word seriously, to obey it with joy to speak it in love and to help one another grow more like Jesus. Lord, grow us into a church that looks like Jesus, thinks like Jesus, and loves like Jesus. Not for our glory, but for Yours. In Jesus’ name we pray, Amen.|

You are the God who makes a way where there seems to be none, and we praise You for this opportunity to share Your love and truth with the school community.<br>Lord, we lift up this new ministry to You.

We know Your heart beats for the salvation of sinners—for the lost to be sought and found. May Your name be hallowed in our words, our lives, our thoughts, and our relationships.
