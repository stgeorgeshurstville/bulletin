## Bible Reading

### Prayer
Dear God, thank you for speaking to us through the Bible. Help us to listen to it, read it, understand it, and hide it in our hearts. May it give us hope and remind us of the life we can have in Jesus. Amen.


### 1 Peter 3:15-16 NIRV

¹⁵ But make sure that in your hearts you honor Christ as Lord. Always be ready to give an answer to anyone who asks you about the hope you have. Be ready to give the reason for it. But do it gently and with respect. ¹⁶ Live so that you don’t have to feel you’ve done anything wrong. Some people may say evil things about your good conduct as believers in Christ. If they do, they will be put to shame for speaking like this about you.
