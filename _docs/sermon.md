### Prayer
Dear God, thank you for letting us know you. Please help us learn from your word. Help us to serve and praise you. **Amen!**

### Isaiah 38-39 (NIV)


**_Hezekiah's Illness_**

³⁸ In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, “This is what the Lord says: Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover.”

² Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord, ³ “Remember, Lord, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.

⁴ Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah: ⁵ “Go and tell Hezekiah, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will add fifteen years to your life. ⁶ And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.

⁷ “‘This is the Lord’s sign to you that the Lord will do what he has promised: ⁸ I will make the shadow cast by the sun go back the ten steps it has gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.’” So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had gone down.

⁹ A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery:
<br>¹⁰ I said, “In the prime of my life
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;must I go through the gates of death
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and be robbed of the rest of my years?”
<br>¹¹ I said, “I will not again see the Lord himself
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;in the land of the living;
<br>no longer will I look on my fellow man,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;or be with those who now dwell in this world.
<br>¹² Like a shepherd’s tent my house
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;has been pulled down and taken from me.
<br>Like a weaver I have rolled up my life,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and he has cut me off from the loom;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;day and night you made an end of me.
<br>¹³ I waited patiently till dawn,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;but like a lion he broke all my bones;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;day and night you made an end of me.
<br>¹⁴ I cried like a swift or thrush,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I moaned like a mourning dove.
<br>My eyes grew weak as I looked to the heavens.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am being threatened; Lord, come to my aid!”
<br><br>
¹⁵ But what can I say?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He has spoken to me, and he himself has done this.
<br>I will walk humbly all my years
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;because of this anguish of my soul.
<br>¹⁶ Lord, by such things people live;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and my spirit finds life in them too.
<br>You restored me to health
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and let me live.
<br>¹⁷ Surely it was for my benefit
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;that I suffered such anguish.
<br>In your love you kept me
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;from the pit of destruction;
<br>you have put all my sins
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;behind your back.
<br>¹⁸ For the grave cannot praise you,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;death cannot sing your praise;
<br>those who go down to the pit
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot hope for your faithfulness.
<br>¹⁹ The living, the living—they praise you,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;as I am doing today;
<br>parents tell their children
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;about your faithfulness.<br><br>

²⁰ The Lord will save me,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and we will sing with stringed instruments
<br>all the days of our lives
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;in the temple of the Lord.
<br>
²¹ Isaiah had said, “Prepare a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil, and he will recover.”

²² Hezekiah had asked, “What will be the sign that I will go up to the temple of the Lord?”
“Virgin Daughter Zion
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;despises and mocks you.
<br>Daughter Jerusalem
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;tosses her head as you flee.
<br>²³ Who is it you have ridiculed and blasphemed?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Against whom have you raised your voice
<br>and lifted your eyes in pride?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the Holy One of Israel!
<br>²⁴ By your messengers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;you have ridiculed the Lord.
<br>And you have said,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;‘With my many chariots
<br>I have ascended the heights of the mountains,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the utmost heights of Lebanon.
<br>I have cut down its tallest cedars,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the choicest of its junipers.
<br>I have reached its remotest heights,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the finest of its forests.
<br>²⁵ I have dug wells in foreign lands 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and drunk the water there.
<br>With the soles of my feet
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.’

²⁶ “Have you not heard?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Long ago I ordained it.
<br>In days of old I planned it;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;now I have brought it to pass,
<br>that you have turned fortified cities
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;into piles of stone.
<br>²⁷ Their people, drained of power,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;are dismayed and put to shame.
<br>They are like plants in the field,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;like tender green shoots,
<br>like grass sprouting on the roof,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;scorched before it grows up.

²⁸ “But I know where you are
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and when you come and go
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and how you rage against me.
<br>²⁹ Because you rage against me
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and because your insolence has reached my ears,
<br>I will put my hook in your nose
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and my bit in your mouth,
<br>and I will make you return
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;by the way you came.

³⁰ “This will be the sign for you, Hezekiah:

“This year you will eat what grows by itself,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and the second year what springs from that.
<br>But in the third year sow and reap,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
<br>³¹ Once more a remnant of the kingdom of Judah
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;will take root below and bear fruit above.
<br>³² For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors.
<br>The zeal of the Lord Almighty
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;will accomplish this.

³³ “Therefore this is what the Lord says concerning the king of Assyria:

“He will not enter this city
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;or shoot an arrow here.
<br>He will not come before it with shield
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;or build a siege ramp against it.
<br>³⁴ By the way that he came he will return;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;he will not enter this city,”
<br>declares the Lord.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;³⁵ “I will defend this city and save it,
<br>for my sake and for the sake of David my servant!”

³⁶ Then the angel of the Lord went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning—there were all the dead bodies! ³⁷ So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.

³⁸ One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisrok, his sons Adrammelek and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.
