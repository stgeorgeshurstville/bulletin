Dear God, thank you for letting us know you. Please help us learn from your word. Help us to serve and praise you. **Amen!**

### Isaiah 49:1-6 (NIV)

**The Servant of the Lord** 

¹ Listen to me, you islands;<br>
hear this, you distant nations:<br>
Before I was born the Lord called me;<br><br>
from my mother’s womb he has spoken my name.<br>
² He made my mouth like a sharpened sword,<br>
in the shadow of his hand he hid me;<br>
he made me into a polished arrow<br>
and concealed me in his quiver.<br>
³ He said to me, “You are my servant,<br>
Israel, in whom I will display my splendor.”<br>
⁴ But I said, “I have labored in vain;<br>
I have spent my strength for nothing at all.<br>
Yet what is due me is in the Lord’s hand,<br>
and my reward is with my God.”<br>

⁵ And now the Lord says—<br>
he who formed me in the womb to be his servant<br>
to bring Jacob back to him<br>
and gather Israel to himself,<br>
for I am honored in the eyes of the Lord<br>
and my God has been my strength—<br>
⁶ he says:<br>
“It is too small a thing for you to be my servant<br>
to restore the tribes of Jacob<br>
and bring back those of Israel I have kept.<br>
I will also make you a light for the Gentiles,<br><br>
that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth.”<br>
