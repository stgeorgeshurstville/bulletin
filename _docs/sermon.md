### Prayer
Dear God, thank you for letting us know you. Please help us learn from your word. Help us to serve and praise you. **Amen!**

### Isaiah 2:1-11 (NIV)
¹ This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
² In the last days
the mountain of the Lord’s temple will be established
as the highest of the mountains;
it will be exalted above the hills,
and all nations will stream to it.

³ Many peoples will come and say,
“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
to the temple of the God of Jacob.
He will teach us his ways,
so that we may walk in his paths.”
The law will go out from Zion,
the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
⁴ He will judge between the nations
and will settle disputes for many peoples.
They will beat their swords into plowshares
and their spears into pruning hooks.
Nation will not take up sword against nation,
nor will they train for war anymore.

⁵ Come, descendants of Jacob,
let us walk in the light of the Lord.

⁶ You, Lord, have abandoned your people,
the descendants of Jacob.
They are full of superstitions from the East;
they practice divination like the Philistines
and embrace pagan customs.
⁷ Their land is full of silver and gold;
there is no end to their treasures.
Their land is full of horses;
there is no end to their chariots.
⁸ Their land is full of idols;
they bow down to the work of their hands,
to what their fingers have made.
⁹ So people will be brought low
and everyone humbled—
do not forgive them.

¹⁰ Go into the rocks, hide in the ground
from the fearful presence of the Lord
and the splendor of his majesty!
¹¹ The eyes of the arrogant will be humbled
and human pride brought low;
the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.
