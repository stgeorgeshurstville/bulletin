Dear God, thank you for letting us know you. Please help us learn from your word. Help us to serve and praise you. **Amen!**

### Isaiah 40 (NIV)


**_Comfort for God's People_** 

⁴⁰ Comfort, comfort my people,
<br>says your God.
<br>² Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,
<br>and proclaim to her
<br>that her hard service has been completed,
<br>that her sin has been paid for,
<br>that she has received from the Lord’s hand
<br>double for all her sins.

<br><br>³ A voice of one calling:
<br>“In the wilderness prepare
<br>the way for the Lord ;
<br>make straight in the desert
<br>a highway for our God. 
<br>⁴ Every valley shall be raised up,
<br>every mountain and hill made low;
<br>the rough ground shall become level,
<br>the rugged places a plain.
<br>⁵ And the glory of the Lord will be revealed,
<br>and all people will see it together.
<br>For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.”

<br><br>⁶ A voice says, “Cry out.”
<br>And I said, “What shall I cry?”

<br><br>“All people are like grass,
<br>and all their faithfulness is like the flowers of the field.
<br>⁷ The grass withers and the flowers fall,
<br>because the breath of the Lord blows on them.
<br>Surely the people are grass.
<br>⁸ The grass withers and the flowers fall,
<br>but the word of our God endures forever.”

<br><br>⁹ You who bring good news to Zion,
<br>go up on a high mountain.
<br>You who bring good news to Jerusalem, 
<br>lift up your voice with a shout,
<br>lift it up, do not be afraid;
<br>say to the towns of Judah,
<br>“Here is your God!”
<br>¹⁰ See, the Sovereign Lord comes with power,
<br>and he rules with a mighty arm.
<br>See, his reward is with him,
<br>and his recompense accompanies him.
<br>¹¹ He tends his flock like a shepherd:
<br>He gathers the lambs in his arms
<br>and carries them close to his heart;
<br>he gently leads those that have young.

<br><br>¹² Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,
<br>or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens?
<br>Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket,
<br>or weighed the mountains on the scales
<br>and the hills in a balance?
<br>¹³ Who can fathom the Spirit of the Lord,
<br>or instruct the Lord as his counselor?
<br>¹⁴ Whom did the Lord consult to enlighten him,
<br>and who taught him the right way?
<br>Who was it that taught him knowledge,
<br>or showed him the path of understanding?

<br><br>¹⁵ Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket;
<br>they are regarded as dust on the scales;
<br>he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust.
<br>¹⁶ Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires,
<br>nor its animals enough for burnt offerings.
<br>¹⁷ Before him all the nations are as nothing;
<br>they are regarded by him as worthless
<br>and less than nothing.

<br><br>¹⁸ With whom, then, will you compare God?
<br>To what image will you liken him?
<br>¹⁹ As for an idol, a metalworker casts it,
<br>and a goldsmith overlays it with gold
<br>and fashions silver chains for it.
<br>²⁰ A person too poor to present such an offering
<br>selects wood that will not rot;
<br>they look for a skilled worker
<br>to set up an idol that will not topple.

<br><br>²¹ Do you not know?
<br>Have you not heard?
<br>Has it not been told you from the beginning?
<br>Have you not understood since the earth was founded?
<br>²² He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth,
<br>and its people are like grasshoppers.
<br>He stretches out the heavens like a canopy,
<br>and spreads them out like a tent to live in.
<br>²³ He brings princes to naught
<br>and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing.
<br>²⁴ No sooner are they planted,
<br>no sooner are they sown,
<br>no sooner do they take root in the ground,
<br>than he blows on them and they wither,
<br>and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff.

<br>²⁵ “To whom will you compare me?
<br>Or who is my equal?” says the Holy One.
<br>²⁶ Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens:
<br>Who created all these?
<br>He who brings out the starry host one by one
<br>and calls forth each of them by name.
<br>Because of his great power and mighty strength,
<br>not one of them is missing.

<br><br>²⁷ Why do you complain, Jacob?
<br>Why do you say, Israel,
<br>“My way is hidden from the Lord;
<br>my cause is disregarded by my God”?
<br>²⁸ Do you not know?
<br>Have you not heard?
<br>The Lord is the everlasting God,
<br>the Creator of the ends of the earth.
<br>He will not grow tired or weary,
<br>and his understanding no one can fathom.
<br>²⁹ He gives strength to the weary
<br>and increases the power of the weak.
<br>³⁰ Even youths grow tired and weary,
<br>and young men stumble and fall;
<br>³¹ but those who hope in the Lord
<br>will renew their strength.
<br>They will soar on wings like eagles;
<br>they will run and not grow weary,
<br>they will walk and not be faint.

<br><br>¹⁰ I said, “In the prime of my life
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;must I go through the gates of death
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and be robbed of the rest of my years?”
<br>¹¹ I said, “I will not again see the Lord himself
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;in the land of the living;
<br>no longer will I look on my fellow man,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;or be with those who now dwell in this world.
<br>¹² Like a shepherd’s tent my house
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;has been pulled down and taken from me.
<br>Like a weaver I have rolled up my life,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and he has cut me off from the loom;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;day and night you made an end of me.
<br>¹³ I waited patiently till dawn,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;but like a lion he broke all my bones;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;day and night you made an end of me.
<br>¹⁴ I cried like a swift or thrush,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I moaned like a mourning dove.
<br>My eyes grew weak as I looked to the heavens.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am being threatened; Lord, come to my aid!”
<br><br>
¹⁵ But what can I say?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He has spoken to me, and he himself has done this.
<br>I will walk humbly all my years
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;because of this anguish of my soul.
<br>¹⁶ Lord, by such things people live;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and my spirit finds life in them too.
<br>You restored me to health
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and let me live.
<br>¹⁷ Surely it was for my benefit
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;that I suffered such anguish.
<br>In your love you kept me
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;from the pit of destruction;
<br>you have put all my sins
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;behind your back.
<br>¹⁸ For the grave cannot praise you,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;death cannot sing your praise;
<br>those who go down to the pit
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot hope for your faithfulness.
<br>¹⁹ The living, the living—they praise you,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;as I am doing today;
<br>parents tell their children
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;about your faithfulness.<br><br>

²⁰ The Lord will save me,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and we will sing with stringed instruments
<br>all the days of our lives
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;in the temple of the Lord.
<br>
²¹ Isaiah had said, “Prepare a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil, and he will recover.”

²² Hezekiah had asked, “What will be the sign that I will go up to the temple of the Lord?”

**_Envoys From Babylon_** (Ch. 39)

³⁹ At that time Marduk-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift, because he had heard of his illness and recovery. ² Hezekiah received the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his storehouses—the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine olive oil—his entire armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.

³ Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked, “What did those men say, and where did they come from?”

“From a distant land,” Hezekiah replied. “They came to me from Babylon.”

⁴ The prophet asked, “What did they see in your palace?”

“They saw everything in my palace,” Hezekiah said. “There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.”

⁵ Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the Lord Almighty: ⁶ The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your predecessors have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the Lord. ⁷ And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood who will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”

⁸ “The word of the Lord you have spoken is good,” Hezekiah replied. For he thought, “There will be peace and security in my lifetime.”
