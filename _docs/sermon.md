Dear God, thank you for letting us know you. Please help us learn from your word. Help us to serve and praise you. **Amen!**



### Isaiah 56:1-8 (NIV)

**Salvation for Others**

¹ This is what the Lord says:  

“Maintain justice  
and do what is right,  
for my salvation is close at hand  
and my righteousness will soon be revealed.  
² Blessed is the one who does this—  
the person who holds it fast,  
who keeps the Sabbath without desecrating it,  
and keeps their hands from doing any evil.”  
³ Let no foreigner who is bound to the Lord say,  
“The Lord will surely exclude me from his people.”  
And let no eunuch complain,  
“I am only a dry tree.”  
⁴ For this is what the Lord says:  

“To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths,  
who choose what pleases me  
and hold fast to my covenant—  
⁵ to them I will give within my temple and its walls  
a memorial and a name  
better than sons and daughters;  
I will give them an everlasting name  
that will endure forever.  
⁶ And foreigners who bind themselves to the Lord  
to minister to him,  
to love the name of the Lord,  
and to be his servants,  
all who keep the Sabbath without desecrating it  
and who hold fast to my covenant—  
⁷ these I will bring to my holy mountain  
and give them joy in my house of prayer.  
Their burnt offerings and sacrifices  
will be accepted on my altar;  
for my house will be called  
a house of prayer for all nations.”  
⁸ The Sovereign Lord declares—  
he who gathers the exiles of Israel:  
“I will gather still others to them  
besides those already gathered.”
