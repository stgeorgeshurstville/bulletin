### Luke 10:38-42 (NIRV) 

**Jesus at the Home of Martha and Mary**

³⁸ Jesus and his disciples went on their way. Jesus came to a village where a woman named Martha lived. She welcomed him into her home. ³⁹ She had a sister named Mary. Mary sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what he said. ⁴⁰ But Martha was busy with all the things that had to be done. She came to Jesus and said, “Lord, my sister has left me to do the work by myself. Don’t you care? Tell her to help me!”

⁴¹ “Martha, Martha,” the Lord answered. “You are worried and upset about many things. ⁴² But few things are needed. Really, only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better. And it will not be taken away from her.”
