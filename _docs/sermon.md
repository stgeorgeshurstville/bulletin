### Psalm 34

**A psalm of David when he was with Abimelek and pretended to be out of his mind. Abimelek drove him away, and David left.**

¹ I will thank the Lord at all times.
My lips will always praise him.
² I will find my glory in knowing the Lord.
Let those who are hurting hear me and be joyful.
³ Join me in giving glory to the Lord.
Let us honor him together.
⁴ I looked to the Lord, and he answered me.
He saved me from everything I was afraid of.
⁵ Those who look to him have joyful faces.
They are never covered with shame.
⁶ This poor man called out, and the Lord heard him.
He saved him out of all his troubles.
⁷ The angel of the Lord stands guard
around those who have respect for him.
And he saves them.
⁸ Taste and see that the Lord is good.
Blessed is the person who goes to him for safety.
⁹ You holy people of God, have respect for the Lord.
Those who respect him have everything they need.

and want to see many good days?
¹³ Then keep your tongues from speaking evil.
Keep your lips from telling lies.

Look for peace, and go after it.

His ears are open to their cry.

He removes all memory of them from the earth.

He saves them from all their troubles.
¹⁸ The Lord is close to those whose hearts have been broken.
He saves those whose spirits have been crushed.

But the Lord saves him from all of them.
²⁰ The Lord watches over all his bones.
Not one of them will be broken.
²¹ Sinners will be killed by their own evil.
The enemies of godly people will be judged.
²² The Lord will save those who serve him.
No one who goes to him for safety will be found guilty.
