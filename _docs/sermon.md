## Bible Reading
### Prayer
Dear God, thank you for letting us know you. Please help us learn from your word. Help us to serve and praise you. **Amen**

### First Reading
*Intro*
More than 700 years before the birth of Jesus, God promised that a son would be born to a virgin, who would call him Immanuel, which means ‘God with us'. The child would be a sign of God's commitment to rescue and keep his people.

### Isaiah 7:10-14
¹⁰ Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz, ¹¹ “Ask the Lord your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights.”
¹² But Ahaz said, “I will not ask; I will not put the Lord to the test.”

¹³ Then Isaiah said, “Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of humans? Will you try the patience of my God also? ¹⁴ Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.

###Second Reading

*Intro*

Matthew proclaims the fulfilment of Isaiah's prophecy and the coming of God in the person of Jesus. As well as being Immanuel, he was called Jesus, because he came to ‘save his people from their sins'.

*Prayer*
Almighty God, thank you for keeping your promise in the birth of Mary's son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Thank you for coming among us to speak to us and give us the hope of new life. Help us to understand the true meaning of Christmas, and to respond to your love with our love. *Amen.*

### Matthew 1:18-25
¹⁸ This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about : His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. ¹⁹ Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.

²⁰ But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. ²¹ She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

²² All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: ²³ “The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel” (which means “God with us”).

²⁴ When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. ²⁵ But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.
