### Prayer
Dear God, thank you for letting us know you. Please help us learn from your word. Help us to serve and praise you. **Amen**

### Luke 19: 30-40 (NIRV)

³⁰ “Go to the village ahead of you. As soon as you get there, you will find a donkey’s colt tied up. No one has ever ridden it. Untie it and bring it here. ³¹ Someone may ask you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ If so, say, ‘The Lord needs it.’ ” 

³² Those who were sent ahead went and found the young donkey. It was there just as Jesus had told them. ³³ They were untying the colt when its owners came. The owners asked them, “Why are you untying the colt?” 

³⁴ They replied, “The Lord needs it.” 

³⁵ Then the disciples brought the colt to Jesus. They threw their coats on the young donkey and put Jesus on it. ³⁶ As he went along, people spread their coats on the road. 

³⁷ Jesus came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives. There the whole crowd of disciples began to praise God with joy. In loud voices they praised him for all the miracles they had seen. They shouted, 

³⁸ “Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!” (Psalm 118: 26) 
“May there be peace and glory in the highest heaven!” 
³⁹ Some of the Pharisees in the crowd spoke to Jesus. “Teacher,” they said, “tell your disciples to stop!” 

⁴⁰ “I tell you,” he replied, “if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.”
