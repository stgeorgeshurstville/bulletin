### Prayer
Dear God, thank you for letting us know you. Please help us learn from your word. Help us to serve and praise you. **Amen**

### Psalm 23

**A psalm of David.**

¹ The Lord is my shepherd. He gives me everything I need.
² He lets me lie down in fields of green grass.
He leads me beside quiet waters.
³ He gives me new strength.
He guides me in the right paths
for the honor of his name.
⁴ Even though I walk
through the darkest valley,
I will not be afraid.
You are with me.
Your shepherd’s rod and staff
comfort me.
⁵ You prepare a feast for me
right in front of my enemies.
You pour oil on my head.
My cup runs over.
⁶ I am sure that your goodness and love will follow me
all the days of my life.
And I will live in the house of the Lord
forever.
