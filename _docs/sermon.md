## Bible Reading

### Prayer
Dear God, thank you for speaking to us through the Bible. Help us to listen to it, read it, understand it, and hide it in our hearts. May it give us hope and remind us of the life we can have in Jesus.  **Amen.**


### Hebrews 4:12-13

¹² For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. ¹³ Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
