### Prayer
Dear God, thank you for letting us know you. Please help us learn from your Word. Help us to serve and praise you. **Amen!**

### Psalm 139 (NIRV)
**For the director of music. A psalm of David.**

¹ Lord, you have seen what is in my heart.
    You know all about me.
² You know when I sit down and when I get up.
    You know what I’m thinking even though you are far away.
³ You know when I go out to work and when I come back home.
    You know exactly how I live.
⁴ Lord, even before I speak a word,
    you know all about it.

⁵ You are all around me, behind me and in front of me.
    You hold me safe in your hand.
⁶ I’m amazed at how well you know me.
    It’s more than I can understand.

⁷ How can I get away from your Spirit?
    Where can I go to escape from you?
⁸ If I go up to the heavens, you are there.
    If I lie down in the deepest parts of the earth, you are also there.
⁹ Suppose I were to rise with the sun in the east.
    Suppose I travel to the west where it sinks into the ocean.
¹⁰ Your hand would always be there to guide me.
    Your right hand would still be holding me close.

¹1 Suppose I were to say, “I’m sure the darkness will hide me.
    The light around me will become as dark as night.”
¹² Even that darkness would not be dark to you.
    The night would shine like the day,
    because darkness is like light to you.

¹³ You created the deepest parts of my being.
    You put me together inside my mother’s body.
¹⁴ How you made me is amazing and wonderful.
    I praise you for that.
What you have done is wonderful.
    I know that very well.
¹⁵ None of my bones was hidden from you
    when you made me inside my mother’s body.
    That place was as dark as the deepest parts of the earth.
When you were putting me together there,
¹⁶     your eyes saw my body even before it was formed.
You planned how many days I would live.
    You wrote down the number of them in your book
    before I had lived through even one of them.

¹⁷ God, your thoughts about me are priceless.
    No one can possibly add them all up.
¹⁸ If I could count them,
    they would be more than the grains of sand.
If I were to fall asleep counting and then wake up,
    you would still be there with me.

¹⁹ God, I wish you would kill the people who are evil!
    I wish those murderers would get away from me!
²⁰ They are your enemies. They misuse your name.
    They misuse it for their own evil purposes.
²¹ Lord, I really hate those who hate you!
    I really hate those who rise up against you!
²² I have nothing but hatred for them.
    I consider them to be my enemies.

²³ God, see what is in my heart.
    Know what is there.
Test me.
    Know what I’m thinking.
²⁴ See if there’s anything in my life you don’t like.
    Help me live in the way that is always right.

### 2 Tim 1:8-10 (NIRV)
⁸ So don’t be ashamed of the message about our Lord. And don’t be ashamed of me, his prisoner. Instead, join with me as I suffer for the good news. God’s power will help us do that.
⁹ God has saved us. He has chosen us to live a holy life. It wasn’t because of anything we have done. It was because of his own purpose and grace. Through Christ Jesus, God gave us this grace even before time began. 
¹⁰ It has now been made known through the coming of our Savior, Christ Jesus. He has broken the power of death. Because of the good news, he has brought life out into the light. That life never dies.
