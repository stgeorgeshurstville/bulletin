Heavenly Father, give us faith to receive your word, understanding to know what it means, and the will to put it into practice; through Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen**.

### Mark 1: 14-20 (NIRV)

**Jesus Preaches the Good News**

¹⁴ After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee. He preached the good news of God. ¹⁵ “The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Turn away from your sins and believe the good news!”

**Jesus Chooses His First Disciples**

¹⁶ One day Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the lake. They were fishermen. ¹⁷ “Come and follow me,” Jesus said. “I will send you out to fish for people.” ¹⁸ At once they left their nets and followed him.

¹⁹ Then Jesus walked a little farther. As he did, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat preparing their nets. ²⁰ Right away he called out to them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men. Then they followed Jesus.
