### Prayer
Dear God, thank you for letting us know you. Please help us learn from your Word. Help us to serve and praise you. **Amen!**

### 2 Corinthians 2: 1-11 (NIrV)


¹ So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you. ² If I make you sad, who is going to make me glad? Only you, the people I made sad. ³ What I wrote to you I wrote for a special reason. When I came, I didn’t want to be troubled by those who should make me glad. I was sure that all of you would share my joy. ⁴ I was very troubled when I wrote to you. My heart was sad. My eyes were full of tears. I didn’t want to make you sad. I wanted to let you know that I love you very deeply.

**Forgive Those Who Make You Sad**

⁵ Suppose someone has made us sad. In some ways, he hasn’t made me sad so much as he has made all of you sad. But I don’t want to put this too strongly. ⁶ He has been punished because most of you decided he should be. This punishment is enough. ⁷ Now you should forgive him and comfort him. Then he won’t be sad more than he can stand. ⁸ So I’m asking you to tell him again that you still love him. ⁹ I wrote to you for another special reason. I wanted to see if you could stand the test. I wanted to see if you could obey everything asked of you. ¹⁰ Anyone you forgive I also forgive. Was there anything to forgive? If so, I have forgiven it for your benefit, knowing that Christ is watching. ¹¹ We don’t want Satan to outsmart us. We know how he does his evil work.
