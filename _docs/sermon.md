## Bible Reading

### Prayer
Dear God, thank you for giving us the Bible. Let it guide us like a light and give us strength. Help us to love and help everyone, with the power of the Holy Spirit and in the name of Jesus Christ. **Amen.**

### Hebrews 4:14-15 (NIRV) 
¹⁴ We have a great high priest. He has gone up into heaven. He is Jesus the Son of God. So let us hold firmly to what we say we believe. ¹⁵ We have a high priest who can feel it when we are weak and hurting. We have a high priest who has been tempted in every way, just as we are. But he did not sin. ¹⁶ So let us boldly approach God’s throne of grace. Then we will receive mercy. We will find grace to help us when we need it.
