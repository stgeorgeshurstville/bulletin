### Isaiah 40 (NIV)


**_Comfort for God's People_** 

⁴⁰ Comfort, comfort my people,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;says your God.
<br>² Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and proclaim to her
<br>that her hard service has been completed,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;that her sin has been paid for,
<br>that she has received from the Lord’s hand
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;double for all her sins.
<br><br>³ A voice of one calling:
<br>“In the wilderness prepare
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the way for the Lord ;
<br>make straight in the desert
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;a highway for our God. 
<br>⁴ Every valley shall be raised up,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;every mountain and hill made low;
<br>the rough ground shall become level,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the rugged places a plain.
<br>⁵ And the glory of the Lord will be revealed,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and all people will see it together.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.”
<br><br>⁶ A voice says, “Cry out.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I said, “What shall I cry?”
<br><br>“All people are like grass,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and all their faithfulness is like the flowers of the field.
<br>⁷ The grass withers and the flowers fall,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;because the breath of the Lord blows on them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely the people are grass.
<br>⁸ The grass withers and the flowers fall,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;but the word of our God endures forever.”
<br><br>⁹ You who bring good news to Zion,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;go up on a high mountain.
<br>You who bring good news to Jerusalem, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;lift up your voice with a shout,
<br>lift it up, do not be afraid;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;say to the towns of Judah,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;“Here is your God!”
<br>¹⁰ See, the Sovereign Lord comes with power,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and he rules with a mighty arm.
<br>See, his reward is with him,
<br>and his recompense accompanies him.
<br>¹¹ He tends his flock like a shepherd:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He gathers the lambs in his arms
<br>and carries them close to his heart;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;he gently leads those that have young.
<br><br>¹² Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens?
<br>Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;or weighed the mountains on the scales
<br>a&nbsp;&nbsp;nd the hills in a balance?
<br>¹³ Who can fathom the Spirit of the Lord,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;or instruct the Lord as his counselor?
<br>¹⁴ Whom did the Lord consult to enlighten him,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and who taught him the right way?
<br>Who was it that taught him knowledge,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;or showed him the path of understanding?
<br><br>¹⁵ Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;they are regarded as dust on the scales;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust.
<br>¹⁶ Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;nor its animals enough for burnt offerings.
<br>¹⁷ Before him all the nations are as nothing;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;they are regarded by him as worthless
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and less than nothing.
<br><br>¹⁸ With whom, then, will you compare God?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;To what image will you liken him?
<br>¹⁹ As for an idol, a metalworker casts it,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and a goldsmith overlays it with gold
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and fashions silver chains for it.
<br>²⁰ A person too poor to present such an offering
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;selects wood that will not rot;
<br>they look for a skilled worker
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;to set up an idol that will not topple.
<br><br>²¹ Do you not know?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you not heard?
<br>Has it not been told you from the beginning?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you not understood since the earth was founded?
<br>²² He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and its people are like grasshoppers.
<br>He stretches out the heavens like a canopy,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and spreads them out like a tent to live in.
<br>²³ He brings princes to naught
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing.
<br>²⁴ No sooner are they planted,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;no sooner are they sown,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;no sooner do they take root in the ground,
<br>than he blows on them and they wither,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff.
<br>²⁵ “To whom will you compare me?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or who is my equal?” says the Holy One.
<br>²⁶ Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who created all these?
<br>He who brings out the starry host one by one
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and calls forth each of them by name.
<br>Because of his great power and mighty strength,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;not one of them is missing.
<br><br>²⁷ Why do you complain, Jacob?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you say, Israel,
<br>“My way is hidden from the Lord;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;my cause is disregarded by my God”?
<br>²⁸ Do you not know?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you not heard?
<br>The Lord is the everlasting God,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the Creator of the ends of the earth.
<br>He will not grow tired or weary,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and his understanding no one can fathom.
<br>²⁹ He gives strength to the weary
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and increases the power of the weak.
<br>³⁰ Even youths grow tired and weary,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and young men stumble and fall;
<br>³¹ but those who hope in the Lord
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;will renew their strength.
<br>They will soar on wings like eagles;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;they will run and not grow weary,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;they will walk and not be faint.
