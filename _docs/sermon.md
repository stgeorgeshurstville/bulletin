### Prayer
Dear God, thank you for letting us know you. Please help us learn from your word. Help us to serve and praise you. **Amen**

### First Reading

**Intro**

More than 700 years before the birth of Jesus, God promised that a son would be born to a virgin, who would call him Immanuel, which means ‘God with us'. The child would be a sign of God's commitment to rescue and keep his people.

### Isaiah 7:10-14
¹⁰ Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz, ¹¹ “Ask the Lord your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights.”
¹² But Ahaz said, “I will not ask; I will not put the Lord to the test.”

¹³ Then Isaiah said, “Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of humans? Will you try the patience of my God also? ¹⁴ Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.

### Second Reading

**Intro**

Matthew proclaims the fulfilment of Isaiah's prophecy and the coming of God in the person of Jesus. As well as being Immanuel, he was called Jesus, because he came to ‘save his people from their sins'.

**Prayer**

Almighty God, thank you for keeping your promise in the birth of Mary's son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Thank you for coming among us to speak to us and give us the hope of new life. Help us to understand the true meaning of Christmas, and to respond to your love with our love. **Amen.**

### Matthew 1:18-25
¹⁸ This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about : His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. ¹⁹ Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.

²⁰ But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. ²¹ She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

²² All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: ²³ “The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel” (which means “God with us”).

²⁴ When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. ²⁵ But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.

**Prayer**

God of grace and truth, we acknowledge our need for Jesus and the forgiveness he made possible by his death on the cross. Turn us away from sin. Help us to live as forgiven children of God and to please you in everything we do, for the sake of Jesus our Saviour. **Amen.**

### Philippians 2:5-11
⁵ In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:

***⁶ Who, being in very nature God,
did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;***

⁷ rather, he made himself nothing
by taking the very nature of a servant,
being made in human likeness.

***⁸ And being found in appearance as a man,
he humbled himself
by becoming obedient to death—
even death on a cross!***

⁹ Therefore God exalted him to the highest place
and gave him the name that is above every name,

***¹⁰ that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
in heaven and on earth and under the earth,***

¹¹ and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

**Prayer**

- For Peace

**The Lords Prayer**

The Lord’s prayer 
Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth as in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins
as we forgive those who sin against us.
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.
For the kingdom, the power,
and the glory are yours
now and for ever.
**Amen.**
