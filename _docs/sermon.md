Dear God, thank you for letting us know you. Please help us learn from your word. Help us to serve and praise you. **Amen!**

### Isaiah 41:2-17 (NIV)


**The Servant of the Lord** 

¹ “Here is my servant, whom I uphold,<br>
my chosen one in whom I delight;<br>
I will put my Spirit on him,<br>
and he will bring justice to the nations.<br>
² He will not shout or cry out,<br>
or raise his voice in the streets.<br>
³ A bruised reed he will not break,<br>
and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out.<br>
In faithfulness he will bring forth justice;<br>
⁴ he will not falter or be discouraged<br>
till he establishes justice on earth.<br>
In his teaching the islands will put their hope.”<br><br>

⁵ This is what God the Lord says—<br>
the Creator of the heavens, who stretches them out,<br>
who spreads out the earth with all that springs from it,<br>
who gives breath to its people,<br>
and life to those who walk on it:<br>
⁶ “I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness;<br>
I will take hold of your hand.<br>
I will keep you and will make you<br>
to be a covenant for the people<br>
and a light for the Gentiles,<br>
⁷ to open eyes that are blind,<br>
to free captives from prison<br>
and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness.<br><br>

⁸ “I am the Lord; that is my name!<br>
I will not yield my glory to another<br>
or my praise to idols.<br>
⁹ See, the former things have taken place,<br>
and new things I declare;<br>
before they spring into being<br>
I announce them to you.”<br><br>

Song of Praise to the Lord<br>
¹⁰ Sing to the Lord a new song,<br>
his praise from the ends of the earth,<br>
you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it,<br>
you islands, and all who live in them.<br>
¹¹ Let the wilderness and its towns raise their voices;<br>
let the settlements where Kedar lives rejoice.<br>
Let the people of Sela sing for joy;<br>
let them shout from the mountaintops.<br>
¹² Let them give glory to the Lord<br>
and proclaim his praise in the islands.<br>
¹³ The Lord will march out like a champion,<br>
like a warrior he will stir up his zeal;<br>
with a shout he will raise the battle cry<br>
and will triumph over his enemies.<br><br>

¹⁴ “For a long time I have kept silent,<br>
I have been quiet and held myself back.<br>
But now, like a woman in childbirth,<br>
I cry out, I gasp and pant.<br>
¹⁵ I will lay waste the mountains and hills<br>
and dry up all their vegetation;<br>
I will turn rivers into islands<br>
and dry up the pools.<br>
¹⁶ I will lead the blind by ways they have not known,<br>
along unfamiliar paths I will guide them;<br>
I will turn the darkness into light before them<br>
and make the rough places smooth.<br>
These are the things I will do;<br>
I will not forsake them.<br>
¹⁷ But those who trust in idols,<br>
who say to images, ‘You are our gods,’<br>
will be turned back in utter shame.<br><br>
