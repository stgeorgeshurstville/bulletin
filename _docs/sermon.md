### Prayer
Dear God, thank you for letting us know you. Please help us learn from your word. Help us to serve and praise you. **Amen!**

### Luke 24: 44-53 (NIRV)

⁴⁴ Jesus said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you. Everything written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms must come true.”

⁴⁵ Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. ⁴⁶ He told them, “This is what is written. The Messiah will suffer. He will rise from the dead on the third day. ⁴⁷ His followers will preach in his name. They will tell others to turn away from their sins and be forgiven. People from every nation will hear it, beginning at Jerusalem. ⁴⁸ You have seen these things with your own eyes. ⁴⁹ I am going to send you what my Father has promised. But for now, stay in the city. Stay there until you have received power from heaven.”

**Jesus Is Taken Up Into Heaven**

⁵⁰ Jesus led his disciples out to the area near Bethany. Then he lifted up his hands and blessed them. ⁵¹ While he was blessing them, he left them. He was taken up into heaven. ⁵² Then they worshiped him. With great joy, they returned to Jerusalem. ⁵³ Every day they went to the temple, praising God.
