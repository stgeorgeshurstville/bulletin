### Prayer
Lord make your word our rule, your Spirit our teacher, and your glory our supreme concern, for the sake of our Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ. **Amen**.

### Mark 6:5-15 (NIV)

⁵ Jesus placed his hands on a few sick people and healed them. But he could not do any other miracles there. ⁶ He was amazed because they had no faith.

**Jesus Sends Out the Twelve Disciples**

Jesus went around teaching from village to village. ⁷ He called the ¹² disciples to him. Then he began to send them out two by two. He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits.

⁸ Here is what he told them to do. “Take only a walking stick for your trip. Do not take bread or a bag. Take no money in your belts. ⁹ Wear sandals. But do not take extra clothes. ¹⁰ When you are invited into a house, stay there until you leave town. ¹¹ Some places may not welcome you or listen to you. If they don’t, leave that place and shake the dust off your feet. That will be a witness against the people living there.”

¹² They went out. And they preached that people should turn away from their sins. ¹³ They drove out many demons. They poured olive oil on many sick people and healed them.

**John the Baptist’s Head Is Cut Off**

¹⁴ King Herod heard about this. Jesus’ name had become well known. Some were saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles.”

¹⁵ Others said, “He is Elijah.”

Still others claimed, “He is a prophet. He is like one of the prophets of long ago.”
