   - Why do we need power from God?
   - Why is Paul thankful to God, the Father? 
3. What does Paul say is ‘how’ the Colossians will live lives worthy of God? V.9 What won’t (see chapter 2)?
   - What is the knowledge of God’d will?
   - How does the Gospel produce a life worthy of God? 
4. Why does Paul pray for this? Why not just preach the Gospel to them?
