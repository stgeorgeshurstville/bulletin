### Key Idea: 
Jesus brings in the new covenant through his sacrifice and the Spirit. 


**Reflection questions:**

1. We didn’t look at Jeremiah 31:1-26. As you read these verses, what’s the picture of the future that’s painted?
2. In verses 27-40, what’s the future that’s painted?
-  In v27-28, why does it include man, beast and plants?
-  In v29-30, why was there this saying and does it make sense?
-  In v31-34, what’s new about this new covenant?
-  In v35-37, what is God trying to say about himself and Israel?
-  In v38-40, what’s different about this city?
3. What does covenant mean?
4. What do we find out about the new covenant in the New Testament?
   - Luke 22:19-21
   - 2 Cor 3:1-6
   - Hebrews 8:7-10:35 (Jeremiah is quoted in Hebrews 8:8, 10:5, 10:16)
 5. One of the key things in this chapter (and in the book of Jeremiah) is the new covenant. What’s different between the old and new covenant? How is the new better? 
6. What do you appreciate the most about the new covenant? 
7. Does this mean that the old covenant was faulty? 
8. What does it mean for us to have new hearts and minds? What does this look like for you?
