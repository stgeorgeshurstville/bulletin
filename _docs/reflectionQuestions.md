order: 7

### Big Idea: 
Rejoice in the relationship we have with God and who God is (rather than in our works or wages) as we see sinners saved. 

### Questions
1. Do you see yourself more as the younger or older brother? 
2. Why were the Pharisees and teachers of the law muttering against Jesus (15:1-3)?
3. Do you ever get jealous when good things happen to bad people (those who don’t deserve it or deserve it as much as others)? 
4. Do you think that God is unfair? 
5. Do you ever think that you are ok with God based on anything apart from Jesus’ life, death and resurrection (e.g. reputation, ministry, upbringing, knowledge, generosity etc)? 
6. What’s stopping you from trusting in Jesus (especially positive things like your track record, good works, comfort etc)? 
7. Similarly, what’s stopping you from loving and welcoming others like God? 
8. Do you realise what we have in Christ (cf Eph 1:3-10)? 
9. How will this help you to trust God and love and rejoice like him?
