### Discussion Questions
1. What is the mission Jesus gave his disciples?
2. Is the mission hard or easy? Which part feels hardest to youâ€”and why?
3. We know the importance of the Cross and the Empty Tomb, but why is the Ascension important?
4. What is Jesus doing right now? How is he doing this? What is your part in this?
5. What difference does the Holy Spirit make to the mission?
6. What barrier is holding you back from shining for Jesus?
7. Pray for someone now. Pray that Jesus might do the driving and you do the following, and not the other way around. Where is JEsus leading you this week?
