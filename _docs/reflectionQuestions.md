order: 7

### Big Idea: 
Our Father in heaven, give us today our daily bread.

### Questions
1. What makes this petition so difficult and strange? Why donâ€™t we pray this? 
2. What do we pray about our daily bread? What does this show about what we think of God and ourselves? How does this shape our values, behaviour? 
3. What does Jesus want us to pray for exactly? How is this a different vision of reality, God, ourselves? How does this give us freedom? What can you do with this freedom?  
4. Pray this prayer everyday.
