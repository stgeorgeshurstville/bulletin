### Big Idea: 
For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.

### Questions
1. When things go bad for you, what’s your response and what’s your attitude towards God? Why?
2. Paul talks about three instances of him suffering at this point. What are they?
3. Imagine you are Paul in this situation. How would you react? What would you write to people who care about you and are supporting you?
4. Paul’s answer is very different to what many of us would’ve said. What is it?
5. What does Paul see as his purpose in life?
6. What does it mean that to die is gain? Can we say this for ourselves?
7. What does it meant that to live is Christ?
8. If this is also our purpose in life, how would we feel and what would it look like?
