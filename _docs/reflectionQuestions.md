### Big Idea: 

Love is better than being free.  



### Questions:

1. What is Paul saying in vv.1-12a?

   What is Paul’s relationship with the Corinthians? What does this mean?

   What does Paul appeal to to establish his rights/freedom?

   God cares for all his creatures - animals and people. How might we muzzle the ox while its treading in our consumption habits?

   60-70% of the church Budget is for the stipend of those who preach the Gospel to and teach the Bible to us. Do we see our offertory as gifts of generosity or paying what we owe? How should this change the way you give? 

2.  Why is Paul telling the Corinthians that he has a right of support from them? Vv.12b-18
   
    The  why’ of Paul setting aside his right is important. What is the reason? 


3. Paul outlines the principle he uses in vv.19-23. Please try to put it in your own words.
   
   Why is the principle not to be sinful or become like the world? If not, what is Paul saying?

   Why is the principle not Gospel utilitarianism (the end justifies the means)? What happens when we operate on Gospel utilitarianism?

   What then is the principle?

   Why do we have to choose between freedom and love? 

4. How are our preferences and comfort hindering others from knowing Jesus and growing in holiness? What are you prepared to set aside/give up in order to love others?
