### Big Idea: 
Pursue love and seek to do what will build the church

### Questions:
 1. What spiritual gifts are you praying for? Why? 

 2. What does Paul mean when he says:

  - ‘pursue love’

  - ‘earnestly desire spirituals’ 

 3. Paul then says that the gift of prophecy is more desirable than the gift of tongues. Paul doesn’t tell us in details what these gifts are (presumably because the Corinthians knew what he’s talking about). From what Paul does say, what are some of the things about the gift of prophecy? 
  - Why should prophecy be more desirable than tongues? 
  - Why is ‘building up the church’? Why is this so good/important? 
  - How does prophecy build up the church? 
 4. In vv.26-39, Paul tells the Corinthians to not use their gifts or limit the use of their gifts. Why? 
 5. Sometimes, love means that we don’t use the gifts God has given us or limit the use. Can you think of when you have done this or could do this? How might this be difficult to do?
 6. Where does St George’s/the wider church need to be build up? What gifts are needed for this? Pray that God will give you the gift to build up the church.
