Big Idea:  Jesus changes how we see one another.  

### Reflection questions
1. Why do you go to church? Would you say that you are a researcher, religious, social, responsible, respectable or some other?
   
   - If you ask the kids at church why you go to church, what would they say?  
 
2. In Thessalonians 2:19, how does Paul describe the Christians at Thessalonica?
   - What do you think he means by this? 

   - How does the Gospel of Jesus enable Paul to see them this way? 

   - How would we behave differently if the people at church are our hope, joy, crown and glory?
