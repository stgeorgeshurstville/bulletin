### Big idea
**Ministry is not about gifts or giftedness. Ministry is love in action. Love gives as well as receives.**

### Discussion Questions
One of the big themes in 2 Corinthians is the idea of ‘boasting’. Just like in our time, people tended to speak highly of themselves because they wanted to appear more impressive than what they actually were. Can you think of an example of someone who tends to boast? Why does Paul say “there is nothing to be gained” by doing this?

1. Paul goes on to speak of a heavenly revelation he received 14 years ago where he was caught up to the third heaven. If there is nothing to be gained from this form of boasting, why is Paul choosing to do so?

2. Paul doesn’t provide many details of this heavenly revelation. For what purpose is he choosing to do this?

3. How does Paul’s example in suffering mirror that of Jesus’? You may like to read Mark 14:32-42. In both examples, we see both men showing their weakness. Whose power are they trusting in?

4. For Paul, why is the grace of God sufficient in our sufferings?

5. How willing are you to share your weaknesses with others at church? How does sharing our weakness become a service for others rather than boasting about our strength?

6. How might the ideas of performance and economic utility and productivity, consumerism and individualism shaped our thinking about gifts and ministry? How does the gospel challenge and correct this?
