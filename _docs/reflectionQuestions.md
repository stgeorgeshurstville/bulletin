### BIG Idea

Sin blinds us to our sin and our need for salvation from Jesus. 

### Reflection questions:
1. _Please read Matthew 7:1-6._
- What is Jesus speaking against here?
- What’s judgmentalism?
- From your experience, what are judgmental people like?
- ‘Self righteous people lack insight into themselves and others.’ Discuss. 
2. _Please read Matthew 7:7-12._
- Is he saying that God will give us everything we ask for? Why and why not? What is Jesus saying then?
- Are there things about yourself that you don’t want to see? Take these to your Father in prayer.
