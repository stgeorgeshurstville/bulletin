### Key Idea
Jesus is able to help because he understands/knows us. 

### Reflection questions
1. Who knows and understands you? How does it feel that they know and understand you?
2. Have you thought about what Jesus is doing now? Why might it be important to know and remember what Jesus is doing now? 

**Please read Hebrews 4:14-15**
1. What is Jesus doing now?
2. What reason does the Bible give (in v.15) for coming to Jesus for help?
   - What difference does it make for you knowing that Jesus understands you?
3. How does Jesus feel about you when you fail, or are in need, or ask him for help?
     - What is stopping you from asking Jesus for help? 
     - What are you doing that might be stopping other people (your kids for example) asking you for help?
