#### Reflection Questions

1. What are some common misconceptions that people have about Jesus?
2. In verses 22-32, Jesus is accused by the Pharisees of being Beelzebul (the Prince of Demons). How does Jesus dispel this accusation?
3. In verses 38-45, the Pharisees ask Jesus for a sign, which he refuses, except for the sign of Jonah. What is the sign of Jonah, and why is it more powerful than anything else Jesus has done or will do in his ministry?
4. In verses 46-50, Jesus' family is ashamed of their association with him. What is the benefit of being a disciple who does his will?
5. Misunderstanding Jesus and remaining in disbelief has grave consequences. What are some of the warnings Jesus gives throughout this passage?
6. Theologian Michael Green summarizes this passage with the following quote: 

“The importance of decision about Jesus reaches a climax. It is possible to be religious, like the Pharisees, and still not be part of the kingdom of God. It is possible to be physically related to the Messiah himself and still not be part of the kingdom of God. Religious practices and religious pedigree are utterly inadequate to bring anyone into the kingdom. There needs to be an acknowledgment of who Jesus is, and a determined decision to follow him.” 

Are you seeing Jesus on his terms?
