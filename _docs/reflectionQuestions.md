title: Reflection Questions
order: 7
---

### Key Idea: 
The world can only be saved by a messiah who is unlike all others.

**Reflection questions:**

1. Please read Jeremiah 21-23. Who is the judgement of the Lord against? and why? 
2. The kings of Judah were confident that they were untouchable Jer 21:13. Why?
3. Josiah knew the Lord, unlike his sons and the people of Judah Jer 22.16. In what way was this demonstrated? How would oppression of the vulnerable prove an ignorance of God?
4. What does the Lord promise in Jer 23.1-8?
5. The Lord promised the end of the Davidic kings in Jer 22.30. Yet He also promised to keep His promise to David in Jer 23.1-8. How can these be reconciled?
6. How will this promised messiah be different to the previous messiahs and all subsequent messiahs?
7. How does Jesus fulfil the promise of Jer 23? How is Jesus different from all human leaders?
8. How might Jer 21-23 be a warning to christian leaders, including christian parents?
9. How might Jesus change the type of relationship and community for those who belong to His kingdom and who has the knowledge of God?
