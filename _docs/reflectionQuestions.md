### Big Idea: 
Come to Jesus, the one who uses all his power and authority to make His Father known to us. And keep going to him.  

### Questions
1. What does Jesus pray for in John 17:1-5? 

2. How does the event of his arrest in John 18:1-12 answer Jesus’ prayer?
      - How is Jesus’ authority demonstrated?
      - How is the glory of Jesus and His Father revealed? 

3. How do we apply this knowledge to our life?
