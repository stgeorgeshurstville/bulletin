### Big Idea: 

God’s gift of singleness help us to look forward to the Kingdom and transforms our understanding of sexuality, ourselves and our relationships. Stoop making marriage/sex/relationship into our god. 



### Questions:

1. What comes to mind when you hear the word ‘single’? 

2. In vv.25-40, Paul speaks of judgement that are not commands from the Lord. IS he saying that he’s ‘just’ giving his opinion on things and we are free to ignore? Why/why not? What does this tell you about the nature of the Word of God? 

3. What are the categories of ‘singles’ whom Paul is writing to? What doesn’t he call them ‘singles’? What does this tell you about how we understand singleness? 

4. What does Paul say to:
  The ‘virgins’ (who are the virgins?)
  Those who are engaged
  Widows 

6. Unlike our culture, Paul priviledges singleness/chastity. Why? How does this critique our own views on marriage/singleness/celibacy/sexuality/sex? 

There seems to be two main reasons given for Paul’s teaching on singleness - Jesus and time (the future). How do these two reasons inform Paul’s teaching? 

Dani Treweed (who’s done her research on singleness - see her [book](https://www.amazon.com.au/Meaning-Singleness-Retrieving-Eschatological-Contemporary/dp/1514004852) and this [web resource](https://www.livingout.org/resources/search?search=singleness) argues that marriage and singleness both point us to the Word to come but in different ways. See this [interview](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2023/mayjune/meaning-singleness-danielle-treweek-eschatology.html) for example. How might singleness points us to the world to come?

6. How does the Gospel change our understanding of singleness and celibacy? 

  If you‘re single, how can you live out the Gospel vision of singleness? Especially with the freedom you have. 
  
  Developing deep loving friendship is a way to express the Gospel vision of our life. How can we be doing this?  

  How does the Gospel help you if yu;re struggling with your singleness? 
  How can we as a community of Christians walk with one another as single and married people?
