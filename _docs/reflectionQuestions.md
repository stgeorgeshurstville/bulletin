### Big Idea: 

Make Jesus and him crucified for everything that we do and say and live for. 



### Questions:


1.	Have you been tempted to feel that Christiniaty has nothing to offer. Please share your experience.
- Please read 1 Corinthians 2
2.	In vv.1-5. Paul reminds the Corinthians of his ministry. ‘What’ is his ministry? How did he do it? And why? 
3.	-The Gospel is wisdom. But not everyone ‘gets it’.
     -Who gets it and who doesn’t? What else does paul say about these two groups? 
     -Who are the ‘mature’? How did they comprehend that the Gospel is wisdom? 
4.	In vv.10b-16 Paul explains who is involved in the mature understanding of the Gospel as wisdom. Who is involved and how? Why is this important?
5.	-Are you aiming to be respectable or conforming to the Cross of Jesus?  
     -What does it mean for you to have confidence in the Cross of Christ? 
     -How could we make everything we do at church and by ourselves focused on knowing Jesus and him crucified?
