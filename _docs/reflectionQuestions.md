#### Big Idea


#### Reflection Questions (Matthew 15:1-39)
1. From Matthew 15:1-20, are traditions inherently good or bad? What type of traditions is Jesus opposed to? How is this a warning to us as a church community?
2. What is the discord that Jesus is making between the Pharisees' traditions and their hearts?
3. In comparison, why is the Gentile woman's faith (Matthew 15:21-28) considered greater than that of the Pharisees?
4. To conclude this section, we have Jesus healing and feeding the crowds on top of a mountain (Matthew 15:29-39). What does this remind you of? You may wish to refer to Isaiah 2:1-5 and Matthew 5:14-16.
