   - What sort of advice do you hear about worrying? How are they helpful/unhelpful? 

2. Jesus turns to talking about ‘treasure’ and worry. How is this related to the ‘righteousness’ that he’s been talking about? 

3.
- According to Jesus, there are two types of treasures: treasures on earth and treasures in heaven.  
- What is a ‘treasure’?
- How are they similar? How are they different? 
- What does it mean to store up treasures in heaven? What doesn’t it mean?

4.
- What is Jesus teaching about worrying? 
- If someone comes to you with anxiety and worries, what might be unhelpful for you to say? How might you lovingly and truthfully respond to them?
