#### Reflection Questions

1. What are some of the "rules" or "games" in our society that can leave us feeling weary and burdened?

2. Matthew 11:25-30 describes Jesus as gentle and humble. What is it about his nature that can guarantee us rest?

3. In Matthew 12:1-14, Jesus and his disciples are accused of breaking the Sabbath. What is Jesus's response to this accusation? Does his action demonstrate lawlessness, or something else?

4. Matthew 12:15-21 connects Jesus to the prophecy in Isaiah 42:1-4. What does this passage reveal about the nature of Jesus's first coming, and how might it contrast with expectations of his second coming?

5. Are you willing to exchange your "yoke" (your burdens and way of doing things) for Jesus's? What might that look like in practice?
