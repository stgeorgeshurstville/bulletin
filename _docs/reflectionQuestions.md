### Key Idea


### Reflection questions:
1.  What is the "good life" that people who come to Australia seek?

2.  How is the good/blessed life that Jesus describes in Matthew 5 different to the “good life” that people seek?

3.  Since Jesus says in Matthew 5:17 that he is the fulfilment of the Old Testament. The keys to understanding the beatitudes (8 blessings) is the background of the Old Testament.
- What are the Old Testament hopes re each of the beatitudes?
- How does Jesus fulfil the hopes and thus bring us “blessedness”?
