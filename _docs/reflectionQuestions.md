### Big Idea: 
Fear God not Man   

### Questions
1. What sort of things make us afraid and/or anxious? How do we deal with these fears and anxiety? 

2. **Please read Isaiah 7.** What was the situation Ahaz and Judah facing? vv.1-2 
 - How did Ahaz respond? 
 - What did the Lord say to Ahaz?
 - What is the ‘sign’ the Lord will give? What is it a sign of?
 - How should Ahaz have responded to the Lord’s promise? How did he respond instead (see 2 Kings 16)?

3. How is Christmas a ‘fulfilment’ of this promise? (Matthew 1:18-25) 

4. In what ways are we more fearful of Man than God? Why do you think we do this? 
 - What does it mean for us to fear God rather than Man? 
 - How might Christmas help us to do this?
