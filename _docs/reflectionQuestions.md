### Reflection questions:

- Which road do you think you are on?

- When you come to God face to face on that last day, what would you say to Him?

- How would you examine yourself against the Bible and test if you are bearing fruit? 

- What do you think about books like 1 John and James? What is that bookâ€™s purpose?

- How would you reconcile divine sovereignty and human effort in the economy of salvation?
