### Big Idea: 
The messiah of God will bring Rest to the World but through Judgement of the Guilty.   

### Questions
1. What might a World at Rest look like? 

Please read Isaiah 11
2. How is the World at Rest pictured vv.6-9? 

Is there anything surprising about this future? 

How will God bring about Rest? 

What will happen to the poor and meek, and the wicked?

How will the Messiah of God bring Rest to the world? 

Why would the nations run towards the Judge? 

4. What word of judgement would the Messiah pronounce on you - ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’?  

	How does the Messiah rule the world today? 

	How would you live as someone who has been ‘justified’?
