### Discussion:

1. In Matthew 9:37–38, Jesus prays for the crowds who are like sheep without a shepherd. As you read, take a moment to pray that God would give you the same compassion for those who do not yet have Jesus as their King.

2. In Matthew 10:5–11, Jesus gives his disciples specific instructions for their mission. Do these instructions apply to us today? If not, how should we understand and apply this passage?

3. In Matthew 10:16–25, Jesus speaks honestly about the challenges his disciples will face. Why are suffering and persecution a necessary part of following him? What might it indicate if we are not experiencing persecution?

4.No one enjoys the thought of persecution. Yet, in Matthew 10:26–42, Jesus gives reasons why representing him to the world is worthwhile. What are they?

5. Are you willing to represent Jesus this week to those in your friends and family who don’t know him?
