### Discussion Questions

**Big Idea**
1. Share how your week was as a living Sacrifice? How has you consciously tried to let the Gospel shape your mind? 

2. What’s more important in Christian ministry-  task or people; character or competency? 

Please read 1 Timothy 4 
3. Timothy is a ‘minister’.  What is the context of his ministry? What is his responsibility? What is the goal of his ministry? 

How are we different to Timothy? How are we the same? 

What is the goal of our ministries? 

4. What would make Timothy a ‘good’ minister? What are the things that he is to ‘do’ or ‘be’? 

What is ‘doctrine’? 

What is Timothy to be an example of? Why? 

What is Timothy to watch closely? Why? 

5. ‘Godliness and character is more important than giftedness.’ How does this challenge the way we think and act in ministry? And how does this change our ministry?
