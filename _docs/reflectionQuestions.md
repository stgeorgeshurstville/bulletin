### Big Idea: 
Actively engage in pursuing holiness by the power of God. Ask him for help. 

### Questions
1. What is this prayer asking for? 

2. Why are we asking for help?
   - How might we be underestimating sin?
   - What is the ‘world, the flesh and the devil’? How do they work and what is their mission? 

3. Is this prayer for protection from sin or overcoming sin? Do you believe that God will answer your prayer? Why?
   - Is this a prayer for sin/evil free life or for holiness? Is there a difference (and what is the difference)?
   - How is this prayer related to mission and evangelism?
4. What might it look like if you were to daily pursue holiness and pray this prayer?
