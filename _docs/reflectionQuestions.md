title: Reflection Questions
order: 7

### Key Idea
 (9:30am) 
Big Idea: Let prayerfulness and wise living character you. 

### Reflection questions
1. How has last week’s passage changed you this week? 

2. Please read Col 4:2-4. 
What does your prayer life reflect about your understanding of and relationship with Jesus?
- How are the Colossians to pray? 
- Do you find prayer easy or hard? If it were hard, what makes it hard?
- Why might Paul be asking for prayer for open doors and clear speech?  

3. Please read Col 4:5,6.
- What might it mean to live wisely to outsiders? 
- What is gracious and salty speech? 
- How is it not just a means to an end? Or it it? If not then what is it? 
- Can you think of a recent example when an outsider asks you about your wise living? 

Can you think of how you might let your speech be full of Jesus - think of a situation of your life - at time, work/school, eating out; think of a subject of conversation - current news?
Might be helpful to remind yourselves of San Chan’s concentric circles of spiritual conversation [here](https://au.thegospelcoalition.org/article/spiritual-conversations/)

4. Consider committing to the 5 days of prayer, and sharing progress at d-group (if any).
