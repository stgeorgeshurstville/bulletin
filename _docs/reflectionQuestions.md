### Reflection questions:

1. Recall a time when it felt like you’re talking through the valley in the shadow of death. What happened? What did it feel like? How did you get through the valley? Where was God on that occasion? What was he doing?
2. In Psalm 23 (read again if needed), which verse stands out to you the most and why?
3. What is David trying to say about Lord by using the ‘shepherd’ metaphor?  
4. What does it mean for you that Jesus is your good shepherd? How might this help when you have to walk through the darkest valley?
