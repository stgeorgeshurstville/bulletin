title: Reflection Questions
order: 6
---

### Big Idea: 

Honour God together (as a church) by taking sin seriously.  


### Questions:

- Paul was addressing 3 problems in 1 Corinthians 5 and 6.
    - What were the problems?
    - Who had the problem and what were they to do?
    - For a primer on Christian sexual ethics - please read this [article](https://www.christ2rculture.com/resources/Ministry-Blog/The-Gospel-and-Sex-by-Tim-Keller.pdf)
    - What is the Bible teaching on sex and how is this different to what our culture teaches?
- How might we have a low view of: 
    - Sin 
    - The church 
- Is there anything you need to repent of? What help/support may you need? How can you support others who might be struggling with temptation and sin?
