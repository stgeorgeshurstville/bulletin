### Key Idea
Thank God for people’s faith in Christ, love for people and hope in heaven through the message of the gospel. 

### Reflection questions
1. Read through the letter of Colossians (about 20 minutes). What things stood out? What questions do you have? Why did Paul write it?
2. What are you usually or mostly thankful for?
3. In the letter, Paul commences by being thankful. What do we find out about his thankfulness (who is he thankful to, why is he thankful, when is he thankful…?)?
4. What can spur our thankfulness for God’s work in people?
5. What’s the relationship between faith, love and hope?
6. How does God work?
7. When does God work?
8. How do we see the Trinity at work and its workings?
9. The Christians in Colossae came to trust in Jesus through the message brought by Epaphras. What is he like and what are we to be like?
