### Key Idea
 (9:30am) 
Big Idea: Bloom where you are planted. 

### Reflection questions
1. How has last week’s passage changed you this week? 

2. Please read Col 3:17-25. 
This looks like a list of dos and don’ts. What might be the problem if this is how we read it? 
- Why is it more than just a list of dos and don’ts? 
- If it’s not just a list of dos and don’ts, what is it? 
- What does it mean to bloom where we are planted? 

3. How do we bloom as:

- Wives
- Husbands
- Children 
- Fathers 
- Slaves 
- Masters 
 
What happens when we fail or feel like we’ve failed? What difference does Jesus make? 

4. What might your family and work life look like if we were to bloom where we’re planted?
