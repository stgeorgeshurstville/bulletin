### Key Idea
 (9:30am) 
Big Idea: Let prayerfulness and wise living character you. 

### Reflection questions
1. How has last week’s passage changed you this week? 

2. Please read Col 4:2-4. 
What does your prayer life reflect about your understanding of and relationship with Jesus?
-How are the Colossians to pray? 
-Do you find prayer easy or hard? If it were hard, what makes it hard?
-Why might Paul be asking for prayer for open doors and clear speech?  

This looks like a list of dos and don’ts. What might be the problem if this is how we read it? 
- Why is it more than just a list of dos and don’ts? 
- If it’s not just a list of dos and don’ts, what is it? 
- What does it mean to bloom where we are planted? 

3. How do we bloom as:

- Wives
- Husbands
- Children 
- Fathers 
- Slaves 
- Masters 
 
What happens when we fail or feel like we’ve failed? What difference does Jesus make? 

4. What might your family and work life look like if we were to bloom where we’re planted?
