### Key Idea

Big Idea: Follow Jesus who is our light/hope of salvation

### Reflection questions:

1. The main point of the account of Jesus’ temptation ISN’T to teach us how to overcome temptation. Discuss.
2. a) Jesus is the fulfilment of “the son of God” (Matthew 2:15; 3:17). What was God’s plan for this “son of God” according to his statement in Matthew 3:17 “…with him I am well pleased”? See the background to this statement in Isaiah 42:1.

b) In what way is the devil tempting Jesus not to fulfil God’s plan?

c) What hope does Jesus’ success in overcoming the devil’s temptations bring to us, according to what follows Jesus’ temptation in 4:12-16?

3. a) In what way are we living in darkness and shadow of death? How does Jesus, the true and faithful son of God, give us hope?
 
Colossians 1:12-14

b) What is the appropriate response toward this true “son of God” according to Matthew 4:20, 22? What things in your life prevent you from whole-heartedly do this?
