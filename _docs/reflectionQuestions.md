### Key Idea: 
God’s message brings judgement and salvation. 


**Reflection questions:**

1. How did the Babylonians treat Judah? 
2. Why did this happen (from a human and God’s perspective)?  
3. Why were Jeremiah and Ebed-Melek saved? 
4. What’s the message we preach to others? 
5. How does this reflect the reality or our belief in God’s judgement and salvation?
