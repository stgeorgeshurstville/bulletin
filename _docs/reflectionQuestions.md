### Big Idea: 
We love one another by serving one another. When we do we bring glory to one God, who is Father, son and Spirit. 

### Questions:
1. Paul begins by talking about ‘spirituals’. What is spirituality? What is transcendence and immanence? How are people around us and you searching for transcendence? 
2. There are two types of spirituality: true and false 12:1-3. What is false/true spirituality? 
3. Paul turns to talk about spiritual gifts in vv.4-11. 
- A.What are spiritual gifts? 
- B.There’s a right and wrong use of spiritual gifts. What are they? 
- C.The gifts are given for the ‘common good’. What does this mean? 
- D.Brian might have mentioned that gifts or roles are not to be confused with Fruit. What might he have meant by this? 
4. Paul then uses the body metaphor to talk about the church in vv.12-31. What is the point that he’s making? 
5. Ministry is more than just joining a roster but a mindset/way of life. How could you express this mind-set? Do you see any part of the Body that you can help build up?
