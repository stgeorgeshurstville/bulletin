### Big Idea: 
Come to Jesus, the one who uses all his power and authority to make His Father known to us. And keep going to him.  

### Questions
1. The Resurrection of Jesus is one of the things that makes the Christianity different from other religions and worldviews. How is it different? How does it make Christians/you different from other people? 

2. Please read John 20:1-18 
What does John tell us about Jesus’ resurrection?

3. We often hear that Jesus’ Resurrection proves: that eEsus is God, there’s life beyond death. What do you think about these
 ideas?
 What does Jesus’ Resurrection show us about:

God 

Eternal life 

Jesus 

How can you remember and witness to the above with other Christians this Easter? 

3. How do we apply this knowledge to our life?
