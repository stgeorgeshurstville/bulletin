#### Reflection Questions

Read Matthew 5:14-16

1. How does Jesus leverage Isaiah's imagery? (Look up Isaiah 2:1-5)
2. Do you think it's possible for Christians to cover their light? Why or why not?
3. What does it mean for your light to shine before others? You may like to look up Philippians 2:14-16, Ephesians 5:8-13 to give you an idea how you can shine.
4. If no one glorifies God through your shining, have you failed?
