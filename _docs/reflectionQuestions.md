### Key Idea: 
There is no salvation withour judgement. God judges and saves through speaking. He speaks through people. 

**Reflection questions:**

The above is Michaelangelo's depiction of Jeremiah on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. If you were to use a picture to say what the book of Jeremiah is about, what would you use?

Please read Jeremiah 1:1-12
1. V.1-3 What was happening at the time of Jeremiah's ministry? (c.f. 2 Kings 22-25)
Underline the word 'word' or 'words' in this passage.
What does the Word of God do? And how does it do it?

2. God would speak to the nations and to Jerusalem to Jeremiah. What would He be saying?
How would Jerusalem respond to what God says?
