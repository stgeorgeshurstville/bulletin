### Reflection questions:

1. Have you ever left out or rejected or know someone who has. How does it feel and what do you/they do as a result? 
2. Please read Luke 15:1-32. Why did Jesus tell these parables? Who are the ‘lost’? What does Jesus tell us  about God’s heart through these stories? 
3. Pray that you would be filled with God’s compassion and that the compassion would overflow. 
4. Think of who has been left out and excluded, what can you do to include them?
