### Big idea
**God is the Father of all compassion and the God of all comfort. He comforts us in our worst afflictions so that we can bring the same comfort to others who are suffering.**

### Discussion Questions
Please read through the whole of 2 Corinthians 2 (at home?). 

Please read 1 Corinthians 1:1-11

1. What is the background to the Corinthians church in Acts 18? What is the relationship between Paul and the church? 

2. Why was Paul writing to them (again!)? 

3. What does Paul want the Corinthians to know? Why? 

4. What do we know about Paul’s affliction? 

5. How is the affliction resolved/not resolved? 

6. How does the Gospel bring  comfort and consolation to Paul (without being simplistic and glib)? Does it work when you need comforting? 

7. How does Paul’s suffering bring comfort to others who are suffering? How might ours? 

8. Write a prayer for those who might be  suffering based on this passage.
