### Big Idea: 

Being known by God allows us to know what’s right and more importantly to love (which may involve giving up our rights)



### Questions:

1. What tricky situations have you been in where there doesn’t seem to be a clear right or wrong answer? 

2. What’s the difference between a Christian who as a weak conscience and one who has a strong conscience? 

3. Is knowledge good? 

4. How can knowledge be bad? 

5. Have you ever used knowledge in an unloving way or to boast yourself up? 

6. What’s so good about being known by God? 

7. When is an issue a core and central one (indisputable) where we must be united or a secondary and more superficial one (disputable) where we can differ? 

8. What would you do in these situations? 
   a. Your relative invites you to their wedding to celebrate and formalise their same sex relationship. 
   b. Your Muslim friend invites you to celebrate the end of Ramadan with their family. 
   c. Your Christian friend says that they don’t have to go to Church or small groups regularly.
   d. Your Christian friend is planning to accept an accounting job for a gambling company. 
   e. Your school is telling all students to wear purple and make a donation on Purple Day to support LGBTIQ+.
   f. Your work is having a raffle to raise money to support transgenderism. 
   g. Your aunt just passed away and her funeral will be done according to Buddhist rituals. 
   h. Your friend’s bucks will involve visiting a strip club. 
   i. Your non-Christian friend has a cigar and offers you one after the Church Service. 

9. What guides Paul’s decision to not eat food offered to idols? 

10. What rights (privileges, freedom, opportunities, hobbies, lifestyle, choices etc.) do you cherish? How willing are you to give this up for others? What would it look like?
