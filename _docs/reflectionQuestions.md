### Discussion Questions
 
- How do you wish people would identify you? Or how have you tried to be identified in the past?

Read Ephesians 2:1-10

- From verses 1-3, how does the world, the flesh and the devil work together as a triple threat to entice us to sin? What does this result in for us? 

- Why do we tend to be influenced by this triple threat in shaping our identity?

- From verses 4-7, What is the gift that God gives? How does receiving it reshape our understanding of who we are?  

- From this passage, why is this new identity worth waiting for, even when life feels hard? 

- From the passage, why canâ€™t the good we do be part of our identity? 

- As our gospel series comes to end, are you convinced that this is a better story that is worth sharing?
