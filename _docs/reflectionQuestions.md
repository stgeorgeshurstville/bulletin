title: Reflection Questions
order: 7

### Big Idea: 
Our prayer life reflects what we think about the One we pray to. The God of Jesus is vastly different to the god of our imagination. 

### Questions
1. Spend time discussing the theme for this year: secure attachment to Jesus’. What is it (and what isn’t it)? Why might this be helpful to you at the moment?  
2. Please read Matthew 6:5-15. How does the context of this passage help us read this teaching on prayer? (Matthew 5:1,2) 
3. Our prayer life reflects on what we think about whom we pray to. What is the difference between Christian prayer and the prayer of the hypocrite and of the pagan? 
4. What is the god of the hypocrite and of the pagan from their prayers? 
5. Who is it that Christian pray to? 
6. What have you learned about who God is through Jesus’ teaching on prayer? What have you learned about prayer?
