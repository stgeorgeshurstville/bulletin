order: 7
---

### Big Idea: 
Our Father in heaven, your kingdom come, your will be done.  

### Questions
1. What does what we pray and how we pray reflect what we think about God, the world and ourselves? 
2. What are you praying for when you pray ‘your kingdom come, your will be done’’? Are we really praying for God’s will be done or ours, in his name? 
3. Why pray to God to do what he’s going to do anyway? 
4. How is God’s kingdom/will different to our kingdom/will? 
5. Spend time praying ‘your kingdom come and your will be done’ in all areas of your life, concern, of what’s happening in the world?
