### Big idea
**The goal of ministry is to building up the church to maturity**

### Discussion Questions
Please read Ephesians 4:1-16 
1. What does Paul say about what Jesus has done and is doing? 

2. Similar to 1 Corinthians 12, Paul compares the church to a body and each member is a part of the body. What do the parts do? 

3. What does it mean for the ‘body’ to be mature? 

4. How does the church grow up? 

5. How mature is St George’s? What is your part in helping St George’s to mature? 

Please reflect on the last few weeks: 

6. What have you learned about the heart of ministry? Anything new? Anything that has challenged you? Any reminders?
