### Discussion Questions

**Big Idea**
Christians serve (it’s like fish swims, or breathing). It’s who we are. Ministry is part of the Christlian life. Christlife life is a life of worship. Worship is a faith and love response to the mercy of God. 

1. In your experience, how do people normally see the ‘problem of ministry’? 

  How are people normally motivated to serve or do ministry? 

**Please read Romans 12:1-3**

2. To what does Paul compare the Christian life v.1? 

  What do you notice about this comparison? 

3. What is the motivation for the Christian life v.1?

  We often think Christian ministry is ‘pay back’. We owe God for what he’s done. What might be unhelpful (even wrong)   about this? If Christian ministry were not ‘pay back’ then what is it? 

4. What is the one thing that Christian are to when offering themselves as a living sacrifice v.1? 

  What is the pattern (of thinking)  of the world? 

  What is the pattern of thinking of the Gospel? 

5. How do we think about ourselves according to the pattern of the world and according to the Gospel? 

  Is this saying that we don’t matter? We are to think nothing of ourselves? What could this be saying instead? 

6. How is your thinking about your self, God, Jesus, others reflected in your approach to christian ministry? 

  How can the Gospel transform your thinking and therefore your ministry?
