#### Big Idea
The kingdom of heaven is demonstrated in what Jesus did - in feeding the 5000 and in walking on water. Jesus is our compassionate Lord who is able and willing to protect, provide and save. 

#### Reflection Questions
Read Matthew 13:1-23

1. Is the kingdom of heaven priceless or worthless? How do you know? 
2. Please read Matthew 14:1-12. What does this tell you about the kingdoms of Man? 
3. Please read Matthew 14:13-36. What does this tell you about the kingdom of Heaven?
4. How could Matthew 14 help you to face: the attack of the evil one; opposition and hardship because of the Word; the worries of this life and the deceptions of wealth?
