### Big idea
**Ministry is not about gifts or giftedness. Ministry is love in action. Love gives as well as receives.**

### Discussion Questions

1. What gifts do you think God has given you? if you're comfortable, ask the people around you. How are you using these gifts?
Please read 1 Cor 12  
2. This chapter isn't really about gifts. but about spirituality. How might the Corinthians think about spirituality and gifts? 
   * How do we think about spirituality and gifts?
   * What are gifts? Are they different from natural talents or roles? If so, how?
   * What is the relationship between gifts and ministry and service? 
3. According to Paul, how should we think about spirituality and gifts instead?  why? What is the relationship between gifts and love? 

How might the ideas of performance and economic utility and productivity, consumerism and individualism shaped our thinking about gifts and ministry? How does the gospel challenge and correct this?
