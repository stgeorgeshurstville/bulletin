### MIG Idea

Jesus has come to save us from our righteousness. 

### Reflection questions:
1.  ‘“All said and done, my friends, it will be an ill day for us if what most humans mean by ‘religion’ ever vanishes from the Earth. It can still send us the truly delicious sins. The fine flower of unholiness can grow only in the close neighbourhood of the Holy. Nowhere do we tempt so successfully as on the very steps of the altar.”’ (C S Lewis, Screwtape Letters) 

- Discuss

2. Please read Matthew 6:1-18. 
- What are the acts of righteousness? 
- What pattern can you see about these acts? 
- What is Jesus not  saying? What is he saying? 
- What is Jesus revealing about our hearts? 
- What is the reward from God (see Matthew 5:1-12)? How do we get this ‘reward’? 
- How is this not salvation by works (try harder)? 

3. Please look at each of the case studies in Matt 5:21-48. 
- Is there a pattern to these?
- How is Jesus revealing what’s in our hearts in these case studies?
- What does Jesus reveal about God?
- How does Jesus fulfil the Law and the Prophets?
- What does holiness/righteousness look like in these areas of life:
a) Sex and marriage
b) Our words
c) Conflict

4. In what ways might you be stealing glory from God? 

- How can you be vigilant and alert? 
- What does it mean for you to surrender to JEsus? 
- How might you make God’s glory your ambition and reason for doing everything? What might this look like?
