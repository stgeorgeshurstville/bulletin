### Key Idea: 
Salvation comes through the defeat of evil (Babylon). And the salvation that results is a complete transformation of sinners where they are made holy.  


**Reflection questions:**
1. Please read Jeremiah 50
    * Who is this oracle about?
    * What will happen to Babylon?
    * What will happen when Babylon falls?
    * How is the salvation of God’s people described here?
2. Jeremiah talked about the forgiveness of God’s people in Chapters 31-33. He mentions this again in the context of the oracle against Babylon. What is the relationship between the Fall of Babylon and the salvation of God’s people? How might this teach us what Jesus would do to save?
