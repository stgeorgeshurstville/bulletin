### 9:30am Song Lyrics<br>

### 1. Come Thou Long Expected Jesus<br>
Come, thou long expected Jesus,<br>
born to set thy people free;<br>
from our fears and sins release us,<br>
let us find our rest in thee.<br>
Israel's strength and consolation,<br>
hope of all the earth thou art;<br>
dear desire of every nation,<br>
joy of every longing heart.<br><br>
 
Born thy people to deliver,<br>
born a child and yet a King,<br>
born to reign in us forever,<br>
now thy gracious kingdom bring.<br>
By thine own eternal spirit<br>
rule in all our hearts alone;<br>
by thine all sufficient merit,<br>
raise us to thy glorious throne.<br><br>
 
Joy to those who long to see thee<br>
Dayspring from on high appear<br>
Come, thou promised Rod of Jesse<br>
Of thy birth we long to hear<br>
O’er the hills the angels singing<br>
News glad tidings of a birth<br>
Go to Him your praises bringing<br>
Christ the Lord has come to earth<br><br>

### 2. Jerusalem<br>
See Him in Jerusalem<br>
Walking where the crowds are<br>
Once these streets had sung to Him<br>
Now they cry for murder<br><br>

Such a frail and lonely Man<br>
Holding up the heavy cross<br>
See Him walking in Jerusalem<br>
On the road to save us<br>
See Him there upon the hill<br>
Hear the scorn and laughter<br>
Silent as a lamb He waits<br>
Praying to the Father<br><br>

See the King who made the sun<br>
And the moon and shining stars<br>
Let the soldiers hold and nail Him down<br>
So that He could save them<br><br>

See Him there upon the cross<br>
Now no longer breathing<br>
Dust that formed the watching crowds<br>
Takes the blood of Jesus<br><br>

Feel the earth is shaking now<br>
See the veil is split in two<br>
And He stood before the wrath of God<br>
Shielding sinners with His blood<br><br>

See the empty tomb today<br>
Death could not contain Him<br>
Once the Servant of the world<br>
Now in victory reigning<br><br>

Lift your voices to the One<br>
Who is seated on the throne<br>
See Him in the New Jerusalem<br>
Praise the One who saved us<br><br>

Lift your voices to the One<br>
Who is seated on the throne<br>
See Him in the New Jerusalem<br>
Praise the One who saved us<br>
Praise the One who saved us<br><br>

### 3. Man of Sorrow<br>
Man of sorrows, Lamb of God
By His own betrayed
The sin of man and wrath of God
Has been on Jesus laid<br><br>

Silent as He stood accused
Beaten, mocked, and scorned
Bowing to the Father's will
He took a crown of thorns<br><br>

Oh, that rugged cross my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
And now my soul cries out hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee<br><br>

Sent of heaven God's own Son
To purchase and redeem
And reconcile the very ones
Who nailed Him to that tree<br><br>

Oh, that rugged cross my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee<br><br>

Now my debt is paid
It is paid in full
By the precious blood
That my Jesus spilled<br><br>

Now the curse of sin
Has no hold on me
Whom the Son sets free
Oh, is free indeed<br><br>

Now my debt is paid
It is paid in full
By the precious blood
That my Jesus spilled<br><br>

Now the curse of sin
Has no hold on me
Whom the Son sets free
Oh, is free indeed<br><br>

Oh, that rugged cross my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee<br><br>

See the stone is rolled away
Behold the empty tomb
Hallelujah, God be praised
He's risen from the grave<br><br>

Oh, that rugged cross my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee<br><br>

Oh, that rugged cross my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee
Praise and honour unto Thee<br><br>

### 4. Arise, Shine (Darkness like a Shroud)<br>
Lift up your voices and lift up your praise<br>
Join with the heavens declaring the wonders<br>
Of His faithfulness forever<br><br>

Sing of the victory, the hope of the world<br>
The Saviour has risen, the Spirit has come to<br>
Bring us into love forever<br><br>

Oh, we are the people of God<br>
With the freedom of hope in our hearts<br>
How great is the love of the Father<br>

Lifted from darkness and into the light<br>
The sons and the daughters are loved at a price<br>
Our God has made us His forever<br><br>

Oh, we are the people of God<br>
With the freedom of hope in our hearts<br>
How great is the love of the Father<br><br>

Oh, we are the people of God<br>
With the freedom of hope in our hearts<br>
How great is the love of the Father<br><br>

This is the song of the redeemed<br>
The ransomed and the free<br>
Given life at such a price<br>
This is love, this is love<br>
And when the Father calls us home<br>
And we see Him on the throne<br>
Hear the voices sing as one<br>
This is love, this is love<br><br>

Oh, we are the people of God<br>
With the freedom of hope in our hearts<br>
How great is the love of the Father<br><br>

Oh, we are the people of God<br>
With the freedom of hope in our hearts<br>
How great is the love of the Father<br><br>
