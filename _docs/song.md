## 9:30am Song Lyrics <br>

### 1. Knowing You Jesus <br>
All I once held dear, built my life upon<br>
All this world reveres, and wars to own<br>
All I once thought gain I have counted loss<br>
Spent and worthless now, compared to this<br><br>

Knowing You, Jesus<br>
Knowing You<br>
There is no greater thing<br>
You're my all, You're the best<br>
You're my joy, my righteousness<br>
And I love You, Lord<br><br>

Now my heart's desire is to know You more<br>
To be found in You and known as Yours<br>
To possess by faith what I could not earn<br>
All-surpassing gift of righteousness<br><br>

Knowing You, Jesus<br>
Knowing You<br>
There is no greater thing<br>
You're my all, You're the best<br>
You're my joy, my righteousness<br>
And I love You, Lord<br><br>

Oh, to know the power of Your risen life<br>
And to know You in Your sufferings<br>
To become like You in Your death, my Lord<br>
So with You to live and never die<br><br>

Knowing You, Jesus<br>
Knowing You<br>
There is no greater thing<br>
You're my all, You're the best<br>
You're my joy, my righteousness<br>
And I love You, Lord<br><br>

Knowing You, Jesus<br>
Knowing You<br>
There is no greater thing<br>
You're my all, You're the best<br>
You're my joy, my righteousness<br><br>

You're my all, You're the best<br>
You're my joy, my righteousness<br>
And I love You, Lord<br>
And I love You, Lord<br><br>

### 2. Speak, O Lord <br>
Speak, O Lord, as we come to You<br>
To receive the food of Your holy Word<br>
Take Your truth, plant it deep in us<br>
Shape and fashion us in Your likeness<br>
That the light of Christ might be seen today<br>
In our acts of love and our deeds of faith<br>
Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us<br>
All Your purposes for Your glory<br><br>

Teach us, Lord, full obedience<br>
Holy reverence, true humility<br>
Test our thoughts and our attitudes<br>
In the radiance of Your purit<br>
Cause our faith to rise, cause our eyes to see<br>
Your majestic love and authority<br>
Words of pow'r that can never fail<br>
Let their truth prevail over unbelief<br><br>

Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds<br>
Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us<br>
Truths unchanged from the dawn of time<br>
That will echo down through eternity<br>
And by grace, we'll stand on Your promises<br>
And by faith, we'll walk as You walk with us<br>
Speak, O Lord, 'til Your church is built<br>
And the earth is filled with Your glory<br><br>

### 3. O Come, All You Unfaithful <br>
O come, all you unfaithful<br>
Come, weak and unstable<br>
Come, know you are not alone<br>
O come, barren and waiting ones<br>
Weary of praying, come<br>
See what your God has done<br><br>

Christ is born, Christ is born<br>
Christ is born for you<br><br>

O come, bitter and broken<br>
Come with fears unspoken<br>
Come, taste of His perfect love<br><br>

O come, guilty and hiding ones<br>
There is no need to run<br>
See what your God has done<br><br>

Christ is born, Christ is born<br>
Christ is born for you<br>
Christ is born, Christ is born<br>
Christ is born for you<br><br>

He’s the Lamb who was given<br>
Slain for our pardon<br>
His promise is peace<br>
For those who believe<br><br>

He’s the Lamb who was given<br>
Slain for our pardon<br>
His promise is peace<br>
For those who believe<br><br>

So come, though you have nothing<br>
Come, He is the offering<br>
Come, see what your God has done<br><br>

Christ is born, Christ is born<br>
Christ is born for you<br>
Christ is born, Christ is born<br>
Christ is born for you<br><br>

### 4. All I have is Christ <br>
Come behold the wondrous mystery<br>
In the dawning of the King<br>
He, the theme of heaven's praises<br>
Robed in frail humanity<br><br>

In our longing, in our darkness<br>
Now the Light of Life has come<br>
Look to Christ, who condescended<br>
Took on flesh to ransom us<br><br>

Come behold the wondrous mystery<br>
He, the perfect Son of Man<br>
In His living, in His suffering<br>
Never trace nor stain of sin<br><br>

See the true and better Adam<br>
Come to save the hell-bound man<br>
Christ the great and sure fulfillment<br>
Of the law; in Him we stand<br><br>

Come behold the wondrous mystery<br>
Christ, the Lord upon the tree<br>
In the stead of ruined sinners<br>
Hangs the Lamb in victory<br><br>

See the price of our redemption<br>
See the Father's plan unfold<br>
Bringing many sons to glory<br>
Grace unmeasured, love untold<br><br>

Come behold the wondrous mystery<br>
Slain by death, the God of life<br>
But no grave could e'er restrain Him<br>
Praise the Lord; He is alive!<br><br>

What a foretaste of deliverance<br>
How unwavering our hope<br>
Christ in power resurrected<br>
As we will be when He comes<br><br>

What a foretaste of deliverance<br>
How unwavering our hope<br>
Christ in power resurrected<br>
As we will be when He comes<br><br>
