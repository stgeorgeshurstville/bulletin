## 9:30am Song Lyrics<br>

### 1. Ancient of Days<br>
Though the nations rage
Kingdoms rise and fall
There is still one King
Reigning over all
So I will not fear for this truth remains:
That my God is the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is the Ancient of Days 

Though the dread of night
Overwhelms my soul
He is here with me
I am not alone
O His love is sure and He knows my name
For my God is the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is the Ancient of Days

Though I may not see
What the future brings
I will watch and wait
For the Saviour King
Then my joy complete standing face to face
In the presence of the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is the Ancient of Days

For my God is the Ancient of Days

### 2. Lord I Lift Your Name On High<br>
Lord, I lift Your name on high  
Lord, I love to sing Your praises  
I'm so glad You're in my life  
I'm so glad You came to save us  

You came from heaven to earth  
To show the way  
From the earth to the cross  
My debt to pay  
From the cross to the grave  
From the grave to the sky  
Lord, I lift Your name on high  

Lord, I lift Your name on high  
Lord, I love to sing Your praises  
I'm so glad You're in my life    
I'm so glad You came to save us  

You came from heaven to earth  
To show the way  
From the earth to the cross  
My debt to pay  
From the cross to the grave  
From the grave to the sky  
Lord, I lift Your name on high  

You came from heaven to earth  
To show the way  
From the earth to the cross  
My debt to pay  
From the cross to the grave  
From the grave to the sky  
Lord, I lift Your name on high  

Lord, I lift Your name on high

### 3. Man of Sorrows<br>
Man of Sorrows, Lamb of God  
By His own betrayed  
The sin of men and wrath of God  
Has been on Jesus laid  

Silent as He stood accused  
Beaten, mocked, and scorned  
Bowing to the Father's will  
He took a crown of thorns  

And oh that rugged cross, my salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"  
Praise and honour unto Thee  

Sent of heaven, God's own Son  
To purchase and redeem  
And reconcile the very ones  
Who nailed Him to that tree  

Oh that rugged cross, my salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"  
Praise and honour unto Thee  

Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full  
By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled  
Now the curse of sin has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free, oh is free indeed!  
Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full  
By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled  
Now the curse of sin has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free, oh is free indeed!  


Oh that rugged cross, my salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"  
Praise and honour unto Thee  

See, the stone is rolled away  
Behold the empty tomb  
Hallelujah, God be praised  
He's risen from the grave!  

Oh that rugged cross, my salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"  
Praise and honour unto Thee  

Praise and honour unto Thee

### 4. Highest Place<br>
Jesus Christ, in very nature God  
Did not grasp hold of His place on the throne  
But took on the nature of a servant  
Made himself nothing, born as a man  
Being found in appearance as a man  
He was obedient to death on a cross  
There he died, God the Son, the maker  
A humble servant, showing the way  

Therefore God exalted him  
to the highest place  
And gave him the name above all names,  
So that at the name of Jesus  
every knee should bow,  
In heaven and on earth  
and under the earth,  
And every tongue confess  
That Jesus is Lord,  
To the glory of God the Father
