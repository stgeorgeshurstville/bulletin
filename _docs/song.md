### 9:30am Song Lyrics
**This is the Day**

This is the day that the Lord has made
We will rejoice as we lift His name
This is the day that the Lord has made
Come and rejoice, we will rejoice and be glad in it

Whether the sun will shine
Whether the skies will rain
I know that You are good
And this is the day You made
Whether in life or death
Whether in joy or pain
I know this truth remains
That this is the day You made

This is the day that the Lord has made
We will rejoice as we lift His name
This is the day that the Lord has made
Come and rejoice, we will rejoice and be glad in it

Now I can walk in faith
You will protect my way
Your every work is good
And this is the day You made
I am a child of Yours
You are the One who saves
I am redeemed by love
And this is the day You made

This is the day that the Lord has made
We will rejoice as we lift His name
This is the day that the Lord has made
Come and rejoice, we will rejoice and be glad in it

This is the day
Come and sing Your praise
For the Lord now reigns
On the throne of grace
Soon is the day
He will bring us home
And we have this hope
For we are His own

This is the day
Come and sing Your praise
For the Lord now reigns
On the throne of grace
Soon is the day
He will bring us home
And we have this hope
For we are His own

This is the day that the Lord has made
We will rejoice as we lift His name
This is the day that the Lord has made
Come and rejoice, we will rejoice and be glad in it
Come and rejoice, we will rejoice and be glad in it

**And Can It Be**

And can it be that I should gain
An int’rest in the Savior’s blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

He left His Father’s throne above,
So free, so infinite His grace;
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam’s helpless race:
’Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me.
’Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me.

Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature’s night;
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my heart was free,
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.
My chains fell off, my heart was free,
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.

No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness Divine,
Bold I approach the eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.
Bold I approach the eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.

Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

**Jesus Thank You**

The mystery of the cross I cannot comprehend
The agonies of Calvary
You the perfect Holy One, crushed Your Son
Who drank the bitter cup reserved for me

Your blood has washed away my sin
Jesus, thank You
The Father’s wrath completely satisfied
Jesus, thank You
Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table
Jesus, thank You

By Your perfect sacrifice I’ve been brought near
Your enemy You’ve made Your friend
Pouring out the riches of Your glorious grace
Your mercy and Your kindness know no end

Your blood has washed away my sin
Jesus, thank You
The Father’s wrath completely satisfied
Jesus, thank You
Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table
Jesus, thank You

Lover of my soul
I want to live for You
Lover of my soul
I want to live for You

Your blood has washed away my sin
Jesus, thank You
The Father’s wrath completely satisfied
Jesus, thank You
Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table
Jesus, thank You

**The Jesus Way**

If you curse me then I will bless you
If you hurt me I will forgive
And if you hate me then I will love you
I choose the Jesus way


If you're helpless I will defend you
And if you're burdened I'll share the weight
And if you're hopeless then let me show you
There's hope in the Jesus way


I follow Jesus
I follow Jesus
He wore my sin
I'll gladly wear His name
He is the treasure
He is the answer
Oh I choose the Jesus way


If you strike me I will embrace you
And if you chain me I'll sing His praise
And if you kill me my home is heaven
For I choose the Jesus way


I follow Jesus
I follow Jesus
He wore my sin
I'll gladly wear His name
He is the treasure
He is the answer
Oh I choose the Jesus way
I choose surrender
I choose to love
Oh God my Savior
You'll always be enough
I choose forgiveness
I choose grace
I choose to worship
No matter what I face


I choose the Jesus way
I choose the Jesus way
I choose the Jesus way
I choose the Jesus way


I follow Jesus
I follow Jesus
He wore my sin
I'll gladly wear His name
He is the treasure
He is the answer
Oh I choose the Jesus way
I choose the Jesus way
