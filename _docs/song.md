### 9:30am Song Lyrics<br>

### 1. Hark the Herald Angels Sing<br>
Hark! the herald angels sing  
“Glory to the newborn King  
Peace on earth, and mercy mild  
God and sinners reconciled!”  
Joyful, all ye nations, rise  
Join the triumph of the skies  
With angelic host proclaim  
“Christ is born in Bethlehem!”  
Hark! the herald angels sing  
“Glory to the newborn King!”  

Christ, by highest Heav’n adored  
Christ the everlasting Lord  
Late in time, behold Him come  
Offspring of a virgin’s womb  
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see  
Hail th’incarnate Deity  
Pleased as man with man to dwell  
Jesus, our Emmanuel  
Hark! the herald angels sing  
“Glory to the newborn King!”  

Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace!  
Hail the Sun of Righteousness!  
Light and life to all He brings  
Ris’n with healing in His wings  
Mild, He lays His glory by  
Born that man no more may die  
Born to raise the sons of earth  
Born to give them second birth  
Hark! the herald angels sing  
“Glory to the newborn King!”

### 2. Lord I Lift Your Name On High<br>
Lord, I lift Your name on high  
Lord, I love to sing Your praises  
I'm so glad You're in my life  
I'm so glad You came to save us  

You came from heaven to earth  
To show the way  
From the earth to the cross  
My debt to pay  
From the cross to the grave  
From the grave to the sky  
Lord, I lift Your name on high  

Lord, I lift Your name on high  
Lord, I love to sing Your praises  
I'm so glad You're in my life    
I'm so glad You came to save us  

You came from heaven to earth  
To show the way  
From the earth to the cross  
My debt to pay  
From the cross to the grave  
From the grave to the sky  
Lord, I lift Your name on high  

You came from heaven to earth  
To show the way  
From the earth to the cross  
My debt to pay  
From the cross to the grave  
From the grave to the sky  
Lord, I lift Your name on high  

Lord, I lift Your name on high

### 3. Man of Sorrows<br>
Man of Sorrows, Lamb of God  
By His own betrayed  
The sin of men and wrath of God  
Has been on Jesus laid  

Silent as He stood accused  
Beaten, mocked, and scorned  
Bowing to the Father's will  
He took a crown of thorns  

And oh that rugged cross, my salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"  
Praise and honour unto Thee  

Sent of heaven, God's own Son  
To purchase and redeem  
And reconcile the very ones  
Who nailed Him to that tree  

Oh that rugged cross, my salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"  
Praise and honour unto Thee  

Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full  
By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled  
Now the curse of sin has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free, oh is free indeed!  
Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full  
By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled  
Now the curse of sin has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free, oh is free indeed!  


Oh that rugged cross, my salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"  
Praise and honour unto Thee  

See, the stone is rolled away  
Behold the empty tomb  
Hallelujah, God be praised  
He's risen from the grave!  

Oh that rugged cross, my salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"  
Praise and honour unto Thee  

Praise and honour unto Thee

### 4. Highest Place<br>
Jesus Christ, in very nature God  
Did not grasp hold of His place on the throne  
But took on the nature of a servant  
Made himself nothing, born as a man  
Being found in appearance as a man  
He was obedient to death on a cross  
There he died, God the Son, the maker  
A humble servant, showing the way  

Therefore God exalted him  
to the highest place  
And gave him the name above all names,  
So that at the name of Jesus  
every knee should bow,  
In heaven and on earth  
and under the earth,  
And every tongue confess  
That Jesus is Lord,  
To the glory of God the Father

To the glory of God the Father
