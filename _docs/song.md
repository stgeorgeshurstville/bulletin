## 9:30am Song Lyrics <br>

### 1. How Great is Our God <br>
The splendour of a King,  <br>
clothed in majesty <br>
Let all the Earth rejoice <br>
All the Earth rejoice <br>

He wraps himself in light <br>
And darkness tries to hide <br>
And trembles at His voice <br>
Trembles at His voice <br> <br>

How great is our God, sing with me <br>
How great is our God, and all will see <br>
How great, how great is our God <br> <br>

Age to age He stands <br>
And time is in His hands <br>
Beginning and the end <br>
Beginning and the end <br> <br>

The Godhead Three in One <br>
Father Spirit and Son <br>
The Lion and the Lamb <br>
The Lion and the Lamb <br> <br>

How great is our God, sing with me <br>
How great is our God, and all will see <br>
How great, how great is our God <br> <br>

Name above all names  <br>
You are worthy of our praise  <br>
And my heart will sing <br>
How great is our God <br> <br>

Name above all names  <br>
You are worthy of our praise  <br>
And my heart will sing <br>
How great is our God <br> <br>

How great is our God, sing with me <br>
How great is our God, and all will see <br>
How great, how great is our God <br> <br>

### 2. Only a Holy God <br>
Who else commands all the hosts of heaven <br>
Who else could make every king bow down <br>
Who else can whisper and darkness trembles <br>
Only a Holy God <br> <br>

What other beauty demands such praises <br>
What other splendour outshines the sun <br>
What other majesty rules with justice <br>
Only a Holy God <br> <br>

Come and behold Him <br>
The One and the Only <br>
Cry out sing holy <br>
Forever a Holy God <br>
Come and worship the Holy God <br> <br>

What other glory consumes like fire <br>
What other power can raise the dead <br>
What other name remains undefeated <br>
Only a Holy God <br> <br>

Come and behold Him <br>
The One and the Only <br>
Cry out sing holy <br>
Forever a Holy God <br>
Come and worship the Holy God <br> <br>

Come and behold Him <br>
The One and the Only <br>
Cry out sing holy <br>
Forever a Holy God <br>
Come and worship the Holy God <br> <br>

Who else could rescue me from my failing <br>
Who else would offer His only Son <br>
Who else invites me to call Him Father <br>
Only a Holy God <br>
Only my Holy God <br> <br>

Come and behold Him <br>
The One and the Only <br>
Cry out sing holy <br>
Forever a Holy God <br>
Come and worship the Holy God <br> <br>

Come and behold Him <br>
The One and the Only <br>
Cry out sing holy <br>
Forever a Holy God <br>
Come and worship the Holy God <br> <br>

### 3.Crown Him with many crowns <br>
Crown Him with many crowns <br>
The Lamb upon His throne <br>
Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns <br>
All music but its own <br> <br>

Awake my soul and sing <br>
Of Him who died for thee <br>
And hail Him as thy matchless King <br>
Through all eternity <br> <br>

Crown Him the Lord of life <br>
Who triumphed o'er the grave <br>
And rose victorious in the strife <br>
For those He came to save <br> <br>

His glories now we sing <br>
Who died and rose on high <br>
Who died eternal life to bring <br>
And lives that death may die <br>
Crown Him the Lord of love <br>
Behold His hands and side <br>
Those wounds yet visible above <br>
In beauty glorified <br> <br>

All hail, Redeemer, hail! <br>
For Thou hast died for me <br>
Thy praise and glory shall not fail <br>
Throughout eternity <br> <br>

### 4. On That Day <br>
I believe in Christ, risen from the dead <br>
He now reigns victorious, His kingdom knows no end <br>
Through His resurrection death has lost its hold <br>
I know on that final day I’ll rise as Jesus rose <br> <br>

On that day we will see you shining brighter than the sun <br>
On that day we will know you as we lift our voice as one <br>
Till that day we will praise you for your never ending grace <br>
And we will keep on singing on that glorious day <br> <br>
 
What a blessed hope, though now tired and worn <br>
We will spend eternity around our Saviour’s throne <br>
Though we grieve our losses we grieve not in vain <br>
For we know our crown of glory waits beyond the grave <br> <br>

On that day we will see you shining brighter than the sun <br>
On that day we will know you as we lift our voice as one <br>
Till that day we will praise you for your never ending grace <br>
And we will keep on singing on that glorious day <br> <br>

Hallelujah what a day it will be <br>
For at home with you my joy is complete <br>
As I run into your arms open wide I will see <br>
My father who is waiting for me <br> <br>

Hallelujah what a day it will be <br>
For at home with you my joy is complete <br>
As I run into your arms open wide I will see <br>
My father who is waiting for me <br>
My father who is waiting for me <br> <br>

On that day we will see you shining brighter than the sun <br>
On that day we will know you as we lift our voice as one <br>
Till that day we will praise you for your never ending grace <br>
And we will keep on singing on that glorious day <br> <br>

On that day we will see you shining brighter than the sun <br>
On that day we will know you as we lift our voice as one <br>
Till that day we will praise you for your never ending grace <br>
And we will keep on singing on that glorious day <br>
And we will keep on singing on that glorious day <br> <br>
