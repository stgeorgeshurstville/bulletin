## 9:30am Song Lyrics <br>

### 1. Knowing You Jesus <br>
All I once held dear, built my life upon<br>
All this world reveres, and wars to own<br>
All I once thought gain I have counted loss<br>
Spent and worthless now, compared to this<br><br>

Knowing You, Jesus<br>
Knowing You<br>
There is no greater thing<br>
You're my all, You're the best<br>
You're my joy, my righteousness<br>
And I love You, Lord<br><br>

Now my heart's desire is to know You more<br>
To be found in You and known as Yours<br>
To possess by faith what I could not earn<br>
All-surpassing gift of righteousness<br><br>

Knowing You, Jesus<br>
Knowing You<br>
There is no greater thing<br>
You're my all, You're the best<br>
You're my joy, my righteousness<br>
And I love You, Lord<br><br>

Oh, to know the power of Your risen life
And to know You in Your sufferings
To become like You in Your death, my Lord
So with You to live and never die

Knowing You, Jesus
Knowing You
There is no greater thing
You're my all, You're the best
You're my joy, my righteousness
And I love You, Lord

Knowing You, Jesus
Knowing You
There is no greater thing
You're my all, You're the best
You're my joy, my righteousness

You're my all, You're the best
You're my joy, my righteousness
And I love You, Lord
And I love You, Lord
