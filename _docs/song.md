### 9:30am Song Lyrics
<br><br>**1. Lights**<br><br>
In the world, it was night
Chains of darkness 'round our hearts
Eyes were blind, minds were closed
Chose to stay within the dark
Couldn't see, couldn't change
Helpless in our darkened state
There we stayed 'til the light of life appeared 

Who can break the chains of darkness?
Who can save?

You are (you are) the light in darkness
You came (you came) to bring salvation
You gave (you gave) your life to free us
You are the light
Then you came as a man
To the earth that you had made
On the cross you gave your life
The darkness seemed to have its way
But then you rose in victory
Death defeated, we are free
Now you reign, calling us into your light
Who can wake us from our slumber?
Who can save?

You are (you are) the light in darkness
You came (you came) to bring salvation
You gave (you gave) your life to free us
You are the light
Who can break the chains of darkness?
Who can save?
Who can wake us from our slumber?
Who can save?
You can break the chains of darkness
You can save
You can wake us from our slumber
You can save


You are (you are) the light in darkness
You came (you came) to bring salvation
You gave (you gave) your life to free us
You are the light
We have (we have) been brought from darkness
We stand (we stand) free from judgement
We give (we give) our lives to serve you
We are your lights

<br><br>**2. Jesus Name Above All Names**<br><br>
Jesus, name above all names
Beautiful Saviour, glorious Lord.
Emmanuel, God is with us.
Blessed Redeemer, Living word.

Jesus, Lord God all Mighty
Wonderful Counsellor, light of the world
The Prince of East, all above glory
Man of sorrow, lamb of God.

Jesus, name above all names
Beautiful Saviour, glorious Lord.
Emmanuel, God is with us.
Blessed Redeemer, living word.

<br><br>**3. You Are My All In All**<br><br>
You are my strength when I am weak
You are the treasure that I seek
You are my all in all
Seeking You like a precious jewel
Lord, to give up I'd be a fool
You are my all in all

Jesus, Lamb of God
Worthy is Your name
Jesus, Lamb of God
Worthy is Your name


Taking my sin, my cross, my shame
Raising again I praise Your name
You are my all in all
When I fall down You pick me up
When I run dry You fill my cup
You are my all in all

Jesus, Lamb of God
Worthy is Your name
Jesus, Lamb of God
Worthy is Your name

Jesus, Lamb of God
Worthy is Your name
Jesus, Lamb of God
Worthy is Your name

<br><br> **4. No Other Name** <br><br>
There is no other name
In heaven can be found
Through whom we are redeemed
Through whom your grace abounds
No other name can save
But Jesus Christ our Lord
 
There is no other name
In heaven can be found
Through whom we are redeemed
Through whom your grace abounds
No other name can save
But Jesus Christ our Lord
 
My joy in sorrow's tears
My strength to cast out fears
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
My hope in darkest night
My broken soul's delight
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
 
There is no victory
But Jesus crucified
No other cure for sin
But that our Saviour died
No other hope we have
But that he rose again
He rose again

My joy in sorrow's tears
My strength to cast out fears
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
My hope in darkest night
My broken soul's delight
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
 
No other throne endures
No other song remains
But ‘Worthy is the Lamb
Who was for sinners slain'
When every knee shall bow
And tongue confess you are Lord
You are Lord
 
My joy in sorrow's tears
My strength to cast out fears
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
My hope in darkest night
My broken soul's delight
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
