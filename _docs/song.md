### 9:30am Song Lyrics
<br><br>**1. Before the Throne of God Above**<br><br>
Before the throne of God above  
I have a strong and perfect plea  
A great High Priest whose name is love  
Who ever lives and pleads for me  
My name is graven on His hands  
My name is written on His heart  
I know that while in heav’n He stands  
No tongue can bid me thence depart  
No tongue can bid me thence depart  

When Satan tempts me to despair  
And tells me of the guilt within  
Upward I look and see Him there  
Who made an end to all my sin  
Because the sinless Savior died  
My sinful soul is counted free  
For God the Just is satisfied  
To look on Him and pardon me  
To look on Him and pardon me  

Behold Him there, the risen Lamb  
My perfect, spotless Righteousness  
The great unchangeable I AM  
The King of glory and of grace  
One with Himself, I cannot die  
My soul is purchased by His blood  
My life is hid with Christ on high  
With Christ my Savior and my God  
With Christ my Savior and my God  

One with Himself, I cannot die  
My soul is purchased by His blood  
My life is hid with Christ on high  
With Christ my Savior and my God  
With Christ my Savior and my God

<br><br>**3. Holy Holy Holy**<br><br>
VERSE 1  
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!  
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;  
Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!  
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!  

VERSE 2  
Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore Thee,  
Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea,  
Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,  
Who wert and art, and evermore shalt be.  

VERSE 3  
 Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide Thee,  
Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see;  
Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,  
Perfect in power, love, and purity.  

VERSE 4  
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!  
All Thy works shall praise Thy name in earth and sky and sea;  
Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!  
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!

<br><br> **4. Build My Life** <br><br>
Worthy of every song we could ever sing  
Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring  
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe  
We live for You, oh, we live for You  

Jesus, the name above every other name  
Jesus, the only one who could ever save  
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe  
We live for You, we live for You  

Holy, there is no one like You, there is none beside You  
Open up my eyes in wonder and  
Show me who You are and fill me with Your heart  
And lead me in Your love to those around me  

Jesus, the name above every other name  
Jesus, the only One who could ever save  
You're worthy of every breath we could ever breathe  
We live for You, oh, we live for You  

Holy, there is no one like You, there is none beside You  
Open up my eyes in wonder and  
Show me who You are and fill me with Your heart  
And lead me in Your love to those around me  

I will build my life upon Your love, it is a firm foundation  
And I will put my trust in You alone, and I will not be shaken  

And I will build my life upon Your love, it is a firm foundation  
And I will put my trust in You alone, and I will not be shaken  

Holy, there is no one like You, there is none beside You  
Open up my eyes in wonder and  
Show me who You are and fill me with Your heart  
And lead me in Your love to those around me
