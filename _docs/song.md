### 9:30am Song Lyrics
<br><br>**1. Here I am to Worship**<br><br>
Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes and let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You


Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You’re altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

King of all days, oh so highly exalted
You're glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to this Earth You created
All for love's sake became poor

Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You’re altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You ‘re altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross

<br><br>**2. Beautiful Saviour (All of My Days)**<br><br>
All my days I will sing this song of gladness
 Give my praise to the fountain of delights
 For in my helplessness, you heard my cry
 And waves of mercy poured down on my life.
 
 I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer
 I will sing of the blood that never fails
 Of sins forgiven of conscience cleansed
 Of death defeated and life without end.
 
 Beautiful Saviour, wonderful counsellor
 Clothed in majesty, Lord of history
 You're the way, the truth, the life.
 
 Star of the morning, glorious in holiness
 You're the risen one, heaven's champion
 And you reign, you reign over all.
 
 All my days I will sing this song of gladness
 Give my praise to the fountain of delights
 For in my helplessness, you heard my cry
 And waves of mercy poured down on my life.
 
 I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer
 I will sing of the blood that never fails
 Of sins forgiven of conscience cleansed.
 
Of death defeated and life without end.

 Beautiful Savior, wonderful counsellor
 Clothed in majesty, Lord of history
 You're the way, the truth, the life.
 
 Star of the morning, glorious in holiness
 You're the risen one, heaven's champion
 And you reign, you reign.
 
 Beautiful Savior, wonderful counsellor
 Clothed in majesty, Lord of history
 You're the way, the truth, the life.
 
 Star of the morning, glorious in holiness
 You're the risen one, heaven's champion
 And you reign, you reign over all
 I long to be where the praise is never ending
 Yearn to dwell where the glory never fades
 Where countless worshippers will share one song
 And cries of "WORTHY!" will honour the Lamb.
 
 Beautiful Savior, wonderful counsellor
 Clothed in majesty, Lord of history
 You're the way, the truth, the life.
 
 Star of the morning, glorious in holiness
 You're the risen one, heaven's champion
 And you reign, you reign over all

<br><br> **3. Living Hope** <br><br>
How great the chasm that lay between us
How high the mountain I could not climb
In desperation, I turned to heaven
And spoke Your name into the night

Then through the darkness, Your loving kindness
Tore through the shadows of my soul
The work is ﬁnished, the end is written
Jesus Christ, my living hope
 
Who could imagine so great a mercy?
What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
The God of ages stepped down from glory
To wear my sin and bear my shame

The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
The King of kings calls me His own
Beautiful Saviour, I'm Yours forever
Jesus Christ, my living hope
 
Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope
Then came the morning that sealed the promise
Your buried body began to breathe
Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
Declared the grave has no claim on me

Then came the morning that sealed the promise
Your buried body began to breathe
Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
Declared the grave has no claim on me
Jesus, Yours is the victory, 

Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope
 
Jesus Christ, my living hope
Oh God, You are my living hope

<br><br> **4. Pass It On** <br><br>
It only takes a spark
To get a fire going
And soon all those around
Can warm up in its glowing

That's how it is with God's love
Once you've experienced it
You spread His love to ev'ryone
You want to pass it on

What a wondrous time is spring
When all the trees are budding
The birds begin to sing
The flowers start their blooming
 
That's how it is with God's love
Once you've experienced it
You want to sing it's fresh like spring
You want to pass it on

I wish for you my friend
This happiness that I've found
You can depend on Him
It matters not where you're bound

I'll shout it from the mountain top
I want the world to know
The Lord of love has come to me
I want to pass it on
 
I'll shout it from the mountain top
I want the world to know
The Lord of love has come to me
I want to pass it on

That's how it is with God's love
Once you've experienced it
You want to sing it's fresh like spring
You want to pass it on
