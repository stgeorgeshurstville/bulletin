### 9:30am Song Lyrics
<br><br>**1. How Great is Our God**<br><br>
The splendour of a King, clothed in majesty
Let all the Earth rejoice
All the Earth rejoice
 
He wraps himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
Trembles at His voice
 
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great is our God
 
Age to age He stands
And time is in His hands
Beginning and the end
Beginning and the end
 
The Godhead Three in One
Father Spirit Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb
 
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great is our God
 
Name above all names 
Worthy of our praise 
My heart will sing
How great is our God
 
Name above all names 
You are worthy of our praise 
And my heart will sing
How great is our God
 
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great is our God

<br><br>**2. Ancient of Days**<br><br>
Though the nations rage
Kingdoms rise and fall
There is still one King
Reigning over all

So I will not fear for this truth remains:
That my God is the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand

All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is the Ancient of Days

Though the dread of night
Overwhelms my soul
He is here with me
I am not alone

O His love is sure and He knows my name
For my God is the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand

All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is the Ancient of Days

Though I may not see
What the future brings
I will watch and wait
For the Saviour King

Then my joy complete standing face to face
In the presence of the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is the Ancient of Days
For my God is the Ancient of Days

<br><br> **3. You Alone** <br><br>
You alone could light the heavens
Speak, and form the universe
Every grain and galaxy
Abiding by Your word
You alone deserve all glory
In one anthem, joyfully raised
Every language, every tongue
Resounding in Your praise
 
Chorus:
Every nation needs to know
There's salvation in Your name alone
For Your kingdom we must go
To all of the earth, all of the earth
 
You alone could ransom sinners
No one else could pay such price
Give for love Your perfect life
In humble sacrifice
You alone have conquered darkness
Death no longer wields its sting
Raised in power to reign forever
Jesus, King of Kings
 
Chorus:
Every nation needs to know
There's salvation in Your name alone
For Your kingdom we must go
To all of the earth, all of the earth
 
You alone restore the broken
Through the weak display Your power
Strengthen us to persevere
Equip us for this hour
Christ alone our ceaseless message
Grace and peace our overflow
Surely You are always with us
Jesus, we will go
 
Chorus:
Every nation needs to know
There's salvation in Your name alone
For Your kingdom we must go
To all of the earth, all of the earth
 
Every nation needs to know
There's salvation in Your name alone
For Your kingdom we must go
To all of the earth, all of the earth

<br><br> **4. God is Our Strength and Refuge** <br><br>
God is our strength and refuge,
Our present help in trouble;
and we therefore will not fear,
though the earth should change!
Though mountains shake and tremble,
though swirling floods are raging,
God the Lord of hosts is with us evermore!
 
There is a flowing river,
Within God's holy city;
God is in the midst of her -
she shall not be moved!
God's help is swiftly given,
thrones vanish at his presence -
God the Lord of hosts is with us evermore!
 
Come, see the works of our maker,
learn of his His deeds all powerful;
wars will cease across the world
when He shatters the spear!
Be still and know your creator,
uplift Him in the nations -
God the Lord of hosts is with us evermore!
