## 9:30am Song Lyrics<br>

### 1. Be Thou my vision<br>
Be Thou my vision<br>
O Lord of my heart<br>
Naught be all else to me<br>
Save that Thou art<br>
Thou my best thought<br>
By day or by night<br>
Waking or sleeping<br>
Thy presence my light<br>

Be Thou my wisdom<br>
Be Thou my true Word<br>
I ever with Thee<br>
And Thou with me Lord<br>
Thou my great Father<br>
I Thy true son<br>
Thou in me dwelling<br>
And I with Thee one<br>

Be Thou my shield<br>
And my sword for the fight<br>
Be Thou my dignity<br>
Be Thou my might<br>
Thou my soul's shelter<br>
And Thou my high tow'r<br>
Raise Thou me heav'nward<br>
O pow'r of my pow'r<br>

Riches I heed not<br>
Nor man's empty praise<br>
Thou mine inheritance<br>
Now and always<br>
Thou and Thou only<br>
Be first in my heart<br>
High King of heaven<br>
My treasure Thou art<br>

High King of heaven<br>
When vict'ry is won<br>
May I reach heaven's joys<br>
O bright heaven's Sun<br>
Heart of my own heart<br>
Whatever befall<br>


### 2. Come Thou Fount<br>
Come Thou fount of ev'ry blessing<br>
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace<br>
Streams of mercy never ceasing<br>
Call for songs of loudest praise<br>

Teach me some melodious sonnet<br>
Sung by flaming tongues above<br>
Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it<br>
Mount of Thy redeeming love<br>

Here I raise mine Ebenezer<br>
Hither by Thy help I'm come<br>
And I hope by Thy good pleasure<br>
Safely to arrive at home<br>

Jesus sought me when a stranger<br>
Wand'ring from the fold of God<br>
He to rescue me from danger<br>
Interposed His precious blood<br>

O to grace how great a debtor<br>
Daily I'm constrained to be<br>
Let Thy grace Lord like a fetter<br>
Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee<br>

Prone to wander Lord I feel it<br>
Prone to leave the God I love<br>
Here's my heart Lord take and seal it<br>
Seal it for Thy courts above<br>



### 3.Only a Holy God<br>
Who else commands all the hosts of heaven<br>
Who else could make every king bow down<br>
Who else can whisper and darkness trembles<br>
Only a Holy God<br>

What other beauty demands such praises<br>
What other splendour outshines the sun<br>
What other majesty rules with justice<br>
Only a Holy God<br>

Come and behold Him<br>
The One and the Only<br>
Cry out sing holy<br>
Forever a Holy God<br>
Come and worship the Holy God<br>

What other glory consumes like fire<br>
What other power can raise the dead<br>
What other name remains undefeated<br>
Only a Holy God<br>

Come and behold Him<br>
The One and the Only<br>
Cry out sing holy<br>
Forever a Holy God<br>
Come and worship the Holy God<br>

Come and behold Him<br>
The One and the Only<br>
Cry out sing holy<br>
Forever a Holy God<br>
Come and worship the Holy God<br>

Who else could rescue me from my failing<br>
Who else would offer His only Son<br>
Who else invites me to call Him Father<br>
Only a Holy God<br>
Only my Holy God<br>

Come and behold Him<br>
The One and the Only<br>
Cry out sing holy<br>
Forever a Holy God<br>
Come and worship the Holy God<br>

Come and behold Him<br>
The One and the Only<br>
Cry out sing holy<br>
Forever a Holy God<br>
Come and worship the Holy God<br>
Come and worship the Holy God<br>
Come and worship the Holy God<br>



### 4. This I Believe (The Creed)<br>
Our Father everlasting<br>
The all creating One<br>
God Almighty<br>

Through Your Holy Spirit<br>
Conceiving Christ the Son<br>
Jesus our Saviour<br>

I believe in God our Father<br>

Our God is three in One<br>
I believe in the resurrection<br>
That we will rise again<br>
For I believe in the Name of Jesus<br>

Our judge and our defender<br>
Suffered and crucified<br>
Forgiveness is in You<br>

Descended into darkness<br>
You rose in glorious life<br>
Forever seated high<br>

I believe in God our Father<br>

I believe in the Holy Spirit<br>

Our God is three in One<br>

I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord<br>

I believe in You<br>
I believe You rose again<br>
I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord<br>

I believe in God our Father<br>

I believe in the Holy Spirit<br>
Our God is three in One<br>
I believe in the resurrection<br>
That we will rise again<br>
For I believe in the Name of Jesus<br>

I believe in life eternal<br>
I believe in the virgin birth<br>
I believe in the saints' communion<br>
And in Your holy Church<br>
I believe in the resurrection<br>
When Jesus comes again<br>
For I believe in the Name of Jesus<br>
For I believe in the Name of Jesus<br>
