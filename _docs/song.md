### 9:30am Song Lyrics<br>

### 1. You Alone<br>
You alone could light the heavens<br>
Speak, and form the universe<br>
Every grain and galaxy<br>
Abiding by Your word<br><br>

You alone deserve all glory<br>
In one anthem, joyfully raised<br>
Every language, every tongue<br>
Resounding in Your praise<br><br>

Every nation needs to know<br>
There's salvation in Your name alone<br>
For Your kingdom we must go<br>
To all of the earth, all of the earth<br><br>

You alone could ransom sinners<br>
No one else could pay such price<br>
Give for love Your perfect life<br>
In humble sacrifice<br><br>

You alone have conquered darkness<br>
Death no longer wields its sting<br>
Raised in power to reign forever<br>
Jesus, King of Kings<br><br>

Every nation needs to know<br>
There's salvation in Your name alone<br>
For Your kingdom we must go<br>
To all of the earth, all of the earth<br><br>

You alone restore the broken<br>
Through the weak display Your power<br>
Strengthen us to persevere<br>
Equip us for this hour<br>
Christ alone our ceaseless message<br>
Grace and peace our overflow<br>
Surely You are always with us<br>
Jesus, we will go<br><br>

Every nation needs to know<br>
There's salvation in Your name alone<br>
For Your kingdom we must go<br>
To all of the earth, all of the earth<br><br>

### 2. Holy Forever (Christmas)<br>
Held within a manger<br>
The Son of God arrived<br>
The One who would be called Emmanuel<br>
The promise was delivered<br>
Unto a virgin bride<br>
The One who would be called Emmanuel<br><br>

Your name is the highest<br>
Your name is the greatest<br>
Your name stands above them all<br>
All thrones and dominions<br>
All powers and positions<br>
Your name stands above them all<br><br>

And the angels cry, "Holy"<br>
All creation cries, "Holy"<br>
You are lifted high, holy<br>
Holy forever<br><br>

In the humble town of David<br>
A Savior born today<br>
The One who would be called Emmanuel<br>
Behold the host of Heaven<br>
With holy roar, proclaim<br>
The One who would be called Emmanuel<br>
The Messiah, our God, is with us now<br><br>

And the angels cry, "Holy"<br>
All creation cries, "Holy"<br>
You are lifted high, holy<br>
Holy forever<br><br>

Hear Your people sing, "Holy"<br>
To the King of Kings, "Holy"<br>
You will always be holy<br>
Holy forever<br><br>

Your name is the highest<br>
Your name is the greatest<br>
Your name stands above them all<br>
All thrones and dominions<br>
All powers and positions<br>
Your name stands above them all<br><br>

Jesus, Your name is the highest<br>
Your name is the greatest<br>
Your name stands above them all<br>
All thrones and dominions<br>
All powers and positions<br>
Your name stands above them all<br><br>

And the angels cry, "Holy"<br>
All creation cries, "Holy"<br>
You are lifted high, holy<br>
Holy forever<br><br>

Hear Your people sing, "Holy"<br>
To the King of Kings, "Holy"<br>
You will always be holy<br>
Holy forever<br><br>

You will always be holy<br>
Holy forever<br><br>

### 3. O Come O Come Emmanuel<br>
O come, O come, Emmanuel<br>
And ransom captive Israel<br>
That mourns in lonely exile here<br>
Until the Son of God appear<br>

O come, Thou, Dayspring from on high<br>
And cause Thy light on us to rise<br>
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night<br>
And death’s dark shadow put to flight<br>

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel<br>
Shall come to thee, O Israel<br>

O come, O come, true prophet of the Lord<br>
And turn the key to heaven’s door<br>
Be Thou our comforter and guide<br>
And lead us to the Father’s side<br>

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel<br>
Shall by His word our darkness dispel<br>

O come, our great High Priest, and intercede<br>
Thy sacrifice, our only plea<br>
The judgment we no longer fear<br>
Thy precious blood has brought us near<br>

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel<br>
Has banished every fear of hell<br>

O Come, Thou King of nations bring<br>
An end to all our suffering<br>
Bid every pain and sorrow cease<br>
And reign now as our Prince of Peace<br>

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel<br>
Shall come again with us to dwell<br>
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel<br>
Shall come again with us to dwell<br>

<br>Standing on this mountaintop
<br>Looking just how far we've come
<br>Knowing that for every step
<br>You were with us
<br><br>Kneeling on this battle ground
<br>Seeing just how much You've done
<br>Knowing every victory
<br>Was Your power in us
<br><br>Scars and struggles on the way
<br>But with joy our hearts can say
<br>Yes, our hearts can say
<br><br>Never once did we ever walk alone
<br>Never once did You leave us on our own
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br><br>Kneeling on this battle ground
<br>Seeing just how much You've done
<br>Knowing every victory
<br>Was Your power in us
<br><br>Scars and struggles on the way
<br>But with joy our hearts can say
<br>Yes, our hearts can say
<br><br>Never once did we ever walk alone
<br>Never once did You leave us on our own
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br><br>Scars and struggles on the way
<br>But with joy our hearts can say
<br>Never once did we ever walk alone
<br>Carried by Your constant grace
<br>Held within Your perfect peace
<br>Never once, no, we never walk alone
<br><br>Never once did we ever walk alone
<br>Never once did You leave us on our own
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br>Every step we are breathing in Your grace
<br>Evermore we'll be breathing out Your praise
<br><br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br>Your are, You are faithful, God, You are faithful
