### 9:30am Song Lyrics
<br><br>**1. Here I am to Worship**<br><br>
Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes and let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You

Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You’re altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

King of all days, oh so highly exalted
You're glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to this Earth You created
All for love's sake became poor

Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You’re altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You ‘re altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross

<br><br>**2. Jesus Name Above All Names**<br><br>
Jesus, name above all names
Beautiful Saviour, glorious Lord.
Emmanuel, God is with us.
Blessed Redeemer, Living word.

Jesus, Lord God all Mighty
Wonderful Counsellor, light of the world
The Prince of East, all above glory
Man of sorrow, lamb of God.

Jesus, name above all names
Beautiful Saviour, glorious Lord.
Emmanuel, God is with us.
Blessed Redeemer, living word.

<br><br>**3. You Are My All In All**<br><br>
You are my strength when I am weak
You are the treasure that I seek
You are my all in all
Seeking You like a precious jewel
Lord, to give up I'd be a fool
You are my all in all

Jesus, Lamb of God
Worthy is Your name
Jesus, Lamb of God
Worthy is Your name


Taking my sin, my cross, my shame
Raising again I praise Your name
You are my all in all
When I fall down You pick me up
When I run dry You fill my cup
You are my all in all

Jesus, Lamb of God
Worthy is Your name
Jesus, Lamb of God
Worthy is Your name

Jesus, Lamb of God
Worthy is Your name
Jesus, Lamb of God
Worthy is Your name

<br><br> **4. No Other Name** <br><br>
There is no other name
In heaven can be found
Through whom we are redeemed
Through whom your grace abounds
No other name can save
But Jesus Christ our Lord
 
There is no other name
In heaven can be found
Through whom we are redeemed
Through whom your grace abounds
No other name can save
But Jesus Christ our Lord
 
My joy in sorrow's tears
My strength to cast out fears
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
My hope in darkest night
My broken soul's delight
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
 
There is no victory
But Jesus crucified
No other cure for sin
But that our Saviour died
No other hope we have
But that he rose again
He rose again

My joy in sorrow's tears
My strength to cast out fears
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
My hope in darkest night
My broken soul's delight
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
 
No other throne endures
No other song remains
But ‘Worthy is the Lamb
Who was for sinners slain'
When every knee shall bow
And tongue confess you are Lord
You are Lord
 
My joy in sorrow's tears
My strength to cast out fears
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
My hope in darkest night
My broken soul's delight
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
