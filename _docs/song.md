### 9:30am Song Lyrics
<br><br>**Only By Grace**<br><br>

Only by grace can we enter 
Only by grace can we stand 
Not by our human endeavour 
But by the blood of the Lamb 
Into Your presence You call us 
You call us to come 
Into Your presence You draw us 
And now by Your grace we come 
And now by Your grace we come 

Lord if You marked our transgressions 
who would stand 
Thanks to Your grace we are cleansed 
by the blood of the Lamb 
Lord if You marked our transgressions 
who would stand 
Thanks to Your grace we are cleansed 
by the blood of the Lamb 
 
Only by grace can we enter 
Only by grace can we stand 
Not by our human endeavour 
But by the blood of the Lamb 
Into Your presence You call us 
You call us to come 
Into Your presence You draw us 
And now by Your grace we come 
And now by Your grace we come

<br><br>**Lord I Lift Your Name on High**<br><br>
Lord, I lift Your name on high.
Lord, I love to sing Your praises.
I'm so glad You're in my life;
I'm so glad You came to save us.

You came from Heaven to earth
To show the way.
From the Earth to the cross,
My debt to pay.
From the cross to the grave,
From the grave to the sky;
Lord, I lift Your name on high.

Lord, I lift Your name on high.
Lord, I love to sing Your praises.
I'm so glad You're in my life;
I'm so glad You came to save us.

You came from Heaven to earth
To show the way.
From the Earth to the cross,
My debt to pay.
From the cross to the grave,
From the grave to the sky;
Lord, I lift Your name on high.

You came from Heaven to earth
To show the way.
From the Earth to the cross,
My debt to pay.
From the cross to the grave,
From the grave to the sky;
Lord, I lift Your name on high.

Lord, I lift Your name on high.

<br><br>**Trust and Obey**<br><br>
When we walk with the Lord
in the light of his word,
what a glory he sheds on our way!
While we do his good will,
he abides with us still,
and with all who will trust and obey.

Trust and obey, for there's no other way
to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear,
not a sorrow we share,
but our toil he doth richly repay;
not a grief or a loss,
not a frown or a cross,
but is blest if we trust and obey.

Trust and obey, for there's no other way
to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.

But we never can prove
the delights of his love
until all on the altar we lay;
for the favor he shows,
for the joy he bestows,
are for them who will trust and obey. 

Trust and obey, for there's no other way
to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet
we will sit at his feet,
or we'll walk by his side in the way;
what he says we will do,
where he sends we will go;
never fear, only trust and obey.

Trust and obey, for there's no other way
to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.

<br><br> **Mighty To Save** <br><br>
[Verse 1]
Well, everyone needs compassion
A love that's never failing
Let mercy fall on me
Well, everyone needs forgiveness
The kindness of a Saviour
The hope of nations

[Chorus]
Saviour, He can move the mountains
And my God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save
Forever, Author of Salvation
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave

[Verse 2]
So take me as You find me
All my fears and failures
And fill my life again
I give my life to follow
Everything I believe in
And now I surrender, I surrender

[Chorus]
Saviour, He can move the mountains
My God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save
Forever, Author of Salvation
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave

[Bridge]
Shine your light and let the whole world see
We're singing for the glory of the risen King, Jesus
Shine your light and let the whole world see
We're singing for the glory of the risen King

[Chorus]
Saviour, He can move the mountains
My God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save
Forever, Author of Salvation
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave
