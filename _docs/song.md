### 9:30am Song Lyrics
<br><br>**1. Here I am to Worship**<br><br>
Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes and let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You


Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You’re altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

King of all days, oh so highly exalted
You're glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to this Earth You created
All for love's sake became poor

Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You’re altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You ‘re altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross

<br><br>**2. Beautiful Saviour (All of My Days)**<br><br>
All my days I will sing this song of gladness
 Give my praise to the fountain of delights
 For in my helplessness, you heard my cry
 And waves of mercy poured down on my life.
 
 I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer
 I will sing of the blood that never fails
 Of sins forgiven of conscience cleansed
 Of death defeated and life without end.
 
 Beautiful Saviour, wonderful counsellor
 Clothed in majesty, Lord of history
 You're the way, the truth, the life.
 
 Star of the morning, glorious in holiness
 You're the risen one, heaven's champion
 And you reign, you reign over all.
 
 All my days I will sing this song of gladness
 Give my praise to the fountain of delights
 For in my helplessness, you heard my cry
 And waves of mercy poured down on my life.
 
 I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer
 I will sing of the blood that never fails
 Of sins forgiven of conscience cleansed.
 
Of death defeated and life without end.

 Beautiful Savior, wonderful counsellor
 Clothed in majesty, Lord of history
 You're the way, the truth, the life.
 
 Star of the morning, glorious in holiness
 You're the risen one, heaven's champion
 And you reign, you reign.
 
 Beautiful Savior, wonderful counsellor
 Clothed in majesty, Lord of history
 You're the way, the truth, the life.
 
 Star of the morning, glorious in holiness
 You're the risen one, heaven's champion
 And you reign, you reign over all
 I long to be where the praise is never ending
 Yearn to dwell where the glory never fades
 Where countless worshippers will share one song
 And cries of "WORTHY!" will honour the Lamb.
 
 Beautiful Savior, wonderful counsellor
 Clothed in majesty, Lord of history
 You're the way, the truth, the life.
 
 Star of the morning, glorious in holiness
 You're the risen one, heaven's champion
 And you reign, you reign over all

<br><br> **4. No Other Name** <br><br>
There is no other name
In heaven can be found
Through whom we are redeemed
Through whom your grace abounds
No other name can save
But Jesus Christ our Lord
 
There is no other name
In heaven can be found
Through whom we are redeemed
Through whom your grace abounds
No other name can save
But Jesus Christ our Lord
 
My joy in sorrow's tears
My strength to cast out fears
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
My hope in darkest night
My broken soul's delight
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
 
There is no victory
But Jesus crucified
No other cure for sin
But that our Saviour died
No other hope we have
But that he rose again
He rose again

My joy in sorrow's tears
My strength to cast out fears
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
My hope in darkest night
My broken soul's delight
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
 
No other throne endures
No other song remains
But ‘Worthy is the Lamb
Who was for sinners slain'
When every knee shall bow
And tongue confess you are Lord
You are Lord
 
My joy in sorrow's tears
My strength to cast out fears
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
My hope in darkest night
My broken soul's delight
No other name but Jesus, Jesus
