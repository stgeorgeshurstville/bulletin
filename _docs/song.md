### 9:30am Song Lyrics<br>

### 1. Hark the Herald Angels Sing<br>
Hark! the herald angels sing  
“Glory to the newborn King  
Peace on earth, and mercy mild  
God and sinners reconciled!”  
Joyful, all ye nations, rise  
Join the triumph of the skies  
With angelic host proclaim  
“Christ is born in Bethlehem!”  
Hark! the herald angels sing  
“Glory to the newborn King!”  

Christ, by highest Heav’n adored  
Christ the everlasting Lord  
Late in time, behold Him come  
Offspring of a virgin’s womb  
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see  
Hail th’incarnate Deity  
Pleased as man with man to dwell  
Jesus, our Emmanuel  
Hark! the herald angels sing  
“Glory to the newborn King!”  

Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace!  
Hail the Sun of Righteousness!  
Light and life to all He brings  
Ris’n with healing in His wings  
Mild, He lays His glory by  
Born that man no more may die  
Born to raise the sons of earth  
Born to give them second birth  
Hark! the herald angels sing  
“Glory to the newborn King!”

### 2. All Heaven Declares<br>
All heaven declares the glory of the risen Lord<br>
Who can compare with the beauty of the Lord?<br>
Forever He will be the Lamb upon the throne<br>
I gladly bow my knee and worship Him alone<br>

I will proclaim the glory of the risen Lord<br>
Who once was slain to reconcile man to God<br>
Forever You will be the Lamb upon the throne<br>
I gladly bow my knee and worship You alone<br>
 
I will proclaim the glory of the risen Lord<br>
Who once was slain to reconcile man to God<br>
Forever You will be the Lamb upon the throne<br>
I gladly bow my knee and worship You alone<br>
 
Forever You will be<br>
The Lamb upon the throne<br>
I gladly bow my knee<br>
And worship You alone<br>
 
Forever You will be<br>
The Lamb upon the throne<br>
I gladly bow my knee<br>
And worship You alone<br>

### 3. O Come, All You Unfaithful<br>
O come, all you unfaithful<br>
Come, weak and unstable<br>
Come, know you are not alone<br>

O come, barren and waiting ones<br>
Weary of praying, come<br>
See what your God has done<br>
 
Christ is born, Christ is born<br>
Christ is born for you<br>

O come, bitter and broken<br>
Come with fears unspoken<br>
Come, taste of His perfect love<br>

O come, guilty and hiding ones<br>
There is no need to run<br>
See what your God has done<br>

Christ is born, Christ is born<br>
Christ is born for you<br>
Christ is born, Christ is born<br>
Christ is born for you<br>

He’s the Lamb who was given<br>
Slain for our pardon<br>
His promise is peace<br>
For those who believe<br>

He’s the Lamb who was given<br>
Slain for our pardon<br>
His promise is peace<br>
For those who believe<br>

So come, though you have nothing<br>
Come, He is the offering<br>
Come, see what your God has done<br>

Christ is born, Christ is born<br>
Christ is born for you<br>
Christ is born, Christ is born<br>
Christ is born for you<br>

### 4. Look to the Skies (Worship the King)<br>
Look to the skies, there’s a celebration<br>
Lift up your heads, join the angel song<br>
For our Creator becomes our Saviour<br>
As a baby born!<br>
Angels, amazed, bow in adoration<br>
‘Glory to God in the highest heaven!’<br>
Send the good news out to every nation<br>
For our hope has come<br>
Worship the King – come, see His brightness<br>
Worship the King, His wonders tell<br>
Jesus our King is born today<br>
We welcome You, Emmanuel<br>
Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God<br>
Father for ever, the Prince of Peace<br>
There’ll be no end to Your rule of justice<br>
For it shall increase<br>
Light of Your face, come to pierce our darkness<br>
Joy of Your heart come to chase our gloom<br>
Star of the morning, a new day dawning<br>
Make our hearts Your home<br>
Worship the King – come, see His brightness<br>
Worship the King, His wonders tell<br>
Jesus our King is born today<br>
We welcome You, Emmanuel<br>
Quietly He came as a helpless baby<br>
One day in power He will come again<br>
Swift through the skies He will burst with splendour<br>
On the earth to reign<br>
Jesus, I bow at Your manger lowly<br>
Now in my life let Your will be done<br>
Live in my flesh by Your Spirit holy<br>
Till Your kingdom comes<br>
Worship the King – come, see His brightness<br>
Worship the King, His wonders tell<br>
Jesus our King is born today<br>
We welcome You, Emmanuel<br>
Emmanuel<br>
