### 9:30am Song Lyrics<br>

### 1. Come Thou Long Expected Jesus<br>
Come, thou long expected Jesus,<br>
born to set thy people free;<br>
from our fears and sins release us,<br>
let us find our rest in thee.<br>
Israel's strength and consolation,<br>
hope of all the earth thou art;<br>
dear desire of every nation,<br>
joy of every longing heart.<br><br>
 
Born thy people to deliver,<br>
born a child and yet a King,<br>
born to reign in us forever,<br>
now thy gracious kingdom bring.<br>
By thine own eternal spirit<br>
rule in all our hearts alone;<br>
by thine all sufficient merit,<br>
raise us to thy glorious throne.<br><br>
 
Joy to those who long to see thee<br>
Dayspring from on high appear<br>
Come, thou promised Rod of Jesse<br>
Of thy birth we long to hear<br>
O’er the hills the angels singing<br>
News glad tidings of a birth<br>
Go to Him your praises bringing<br>
Christ the Lord has come to earth<br><br>

### 2. Jerusalem<br>
See Him in Jerusalem
Walking where the crowds are
Once these streets had sung to Him
Now they cry for murder

Such a frail and lonely Man
Holding up the heavy cross
See Him walking in Jerusalem
On the road to save us
See Him there upon the hill
Hear the scorn and laughter
Silent as a lamb He waits
Praying to the Father

See the King who made the sun
And the moon and shining stars
Let the soldiers hold and nail Him down
So that He could save them

See Him there upon the cross
Now no longer breathing
Dust that formed the watching crowds
Takes the blood of Jesus

Feel the earth is shaking now
See the veil is split in two
And He stood before the wrath of God
Shielding sinners with His blood

See the empty tomb today
Death could not contain Him
Once the Servant of the world
Now in victory reigning

Lift your voices to the One
Who is seated on the throne
See Him in the New Jerusalem
Praise the One who saved us

Lift your voices to the One
Who is seated on the throne
See Him in the New Jerusalem
Praise the One who saved us
Praise the One who saved us

### 3. Man of Sorrow<br>
Man of sorrows, Lamb of God
By His own betrayed
The sin of man and wrath of God
Has been on Jesus laid<br><br>

Silent as He stood accused
Beaten, mocked, and scorned
Bowing to the Father's will
He took a crown of thorns<br><br>

Oh, that rugged cross my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
And now my soul cries out hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee<br><br>

Sent of heaven God's own Son
To purchase and redeem
And reconcile the very ones
Who nailed Him to that tree<br><br>

Oh, that rugged cross my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee<br><br>

Now my debt is paid
It is paid in full
By the precious blood
That my Jesus spilled<br><br>

Now the curse of sin
Has no hold on me
Whom the Son sets free
Oh, is free indeed<br><br>

Now my debt is paid
It is paid in full
By the precious blood
That my Jesus spilled<br><br>

Now the curse of sin
Has no hold on me
Whom the Son sets free
Oh, is free indeed<br><br>

Oh, that rugged cross my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee<br><br>

See the stone is rolled away
Behold the empty tomb
Hallelujah, God be praised
He's risen from the grave<br><br>

Oh, that rugged cross my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee<br><br>

Oh, that rugged cross my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee
Praise and honour unto Thee<br><br>

### 4. Arise, Shine (Darkness like a Shroud)<br>
Lift up your voices and lift up your praise<br>
Join with the heavens declaring the wonders<br>
Of His faithfulness forever<br><br>

Sing of the victory, the hope of the world<br>
The Saviour has risen, the Spirit has come to<br>
Bring us into love forever<br><br>

Oh, we are the people of God<br>
With the freedom of hope in our hearts<br>
How great is the love of the Father<br>

Lifted from darkness and into the light<br>
The sons and the daughters are loved at a price<br>
Our God has made us His forever<br><br>

Oh, we are the people of God<br>
With the freedom of hope in our hearts<br>
How great is the love of the Father<br><br>

Oh, we are the people of God<br>
With the freedom of hope in our hearts<br>
How great is the love of the Father<br><br>

This is the song of the redeemed<br>
The ransomed and the free<br>
Given life at such a price<br>
This is love, this is love<br>
And when the Father calls us home<br>
And we see Him on the throne<br>
Hear the voices sing as one<br>
This is love, this is love<br><br>

Oh, we are the people of God<br>
With the freedom of hope in our hearts<br>
How great is the love of the Father<br><br>

Oh, we are the people of God<br>
With the freedom of hope in our hearts<br>
How great is the love of the Father<br><br>
