### 9:30am Song Lyrics<br>

### 1. Away in a Manger<br>
Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,<br>
the little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head;<br>
the stars in the heavens looked down where He lay,<br>
the little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.<br>
The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes,<br>
but little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes.<br>
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky<br>
and stay by my side until morning is nigh.<br>
Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask Thee to stay<br>
close by me forever, and love me, I pray.<br>
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care,<br>
and fit us for heaven, to live with Thee there.<br>

### 2. All Heaven Declares<br>
All heaven declares the glory of the risen Lord<br>
Who can compare with the beauty of the Lord?<br>
Forever He will be the Lamb upon the throne<br>
I gladly bow my knee and worship Him alone<br>

I will proclaim the glory of the risen Lord<br>
Who once was slain to reconcile man to God<br>
Forever You will be the Lamb upon the throne<br>
I gladly bow my knee and worship You alone<br>
 
I will proclaim the glory of the risen Lord<br>
Who once was slain to reconcile man to God<br>
Forever You will be the Lamb upon the throne<br>
I gladly bow my knee and worship You alone<br>
 
Forever You will be<br>
The Lamb upon the throne<br>
I gladly bow my knee<br>
And worship You alone<br>
 
Forever You will be<br>
The Lamb upon the throne<br>
I gladly bow my knee<br>
And worship You alone<br>

### 3. O Come, All You Unfaithful<br>
O come, all you unfaithful<br>
Come, weak and unstable<br>
Come, know you are not alone<br>

O come, barren and waiting ones<br>
Weary of praying, come<br>
See what your God has done<br>
 
Christ is born, Christ is born<br>
Christ is born for you<br>

O come, bitter and broken<br>
Come with fears unspoken<br>
Come, taste of His perfect love<br>

O come, guilty and hiding ones<br>
There is no need to run<br>
See what your God has done<br>

Christ is born, Christ is born<br>
Christ is born for you<br>
Christ is born, Christ is born<br>
Christ is born for you<br>

He’s the Lamb who was given<br>
Slain for our pardon<br>
His promise is peace<br>
For those who believe<br>

He’s the Lamb who was given<br>
Slain for our pardon<br>
His promise is peace<br>
For those who believe<br>

So come, though you have nothing<br>
Come, He is the offering<br>
Come, see what your God has done<br>

Christ is born, Christ is born<br>
Christ is born for you<br>
Christ is born, Christ is born<br>
Christ is born for you<br>

### 4. Look to the Skies (Worship the King)<br>
Look to the skies, there’s a celebration<br>
Lift up your heads, join the angel song<br>
For our Creator becomes our Saviour<br>
As a baby born!<br>
Angels, amazed, bow in adoration<br>
‘Glory to God in the highest heaven!’<br>
Send the good news out to every nation<br>
For our hope has come<br>
Worship the King – come, see His brightness<br>
Worship the King, His wonders tell<br>
Jesus our King is born today<br>
We welcome You, Emmanuel<br>
Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God<br>
Father for ever, the Prince of Peace<br>
There’ll be no end to Your rule of justice<br>
For it shall increase<br>
Light of Your face, come to pierce our darkness<br>
Joy of Your heart come to chase our gloom<br>
Star of the morning, a new day dawning<br>
Make our hearts Your home<br>
Worship the King – come, see His brightness<br>
Worship the King, His wonders tell<br>
Jesus our King is born today<br>
We welcome You, Emmanuel<br>
Quietly He came as a helpless baby<br>
One day in power He will come again<br>
Swift through the skies He will burst with splendour<br>
On the earth to reign<br>
Jesus, I bow at Your manger lowly<br>
Now in my life let Your will be done<br>
Live in my flesh by Your Spirit holy<br>
Till Your kingdom comes<br>
Worship the King – come, see His brightness<br>
Worship the King, His wonders tell<br>
Jesus our King is born today<br>
We welcome You, Emmanuel<br>
Emmanuel<br>
