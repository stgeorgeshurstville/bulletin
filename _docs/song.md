### 9:30am Song Lyrics
<br><br>**1. Holy Forever**<br><br>
<br>A thousand generations falling down in worship
<br>To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
<br>And all who’ve gone before us and all who will believe
<br>Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb
<br><br>Your name is the highest
<br>Your name is the greatest
<br>Your name stands above them all
<br>All thrones and dominions
<br>All powers and positions
<br>Your name stands above them all
<br><br>And the angels cry, Holy
<br>All creation cries, Holy
<br>You are lifted high, Holy
<br>Holy forever
<br><br>If you’ve been forgiven and if you’ve been redeemed
<br>Sing the song forever to the Lamb
<br>If you walk in freedom and if you bear His name
<br>Sing the song forever to the Lamb
<br>We’ll sing the song forever and amen
<br><br>And the angels cry, Holy
<br>All creation cries, Holy
<br>You are lifted high, Holy
<br>Holy forever
<br><br>Your name is the highest
<br>Your name is the greatest
<br>Your name stands above them all
<br>All thrones and dominions
<br>All powers and positions
<br>Your name stands above them all
<br><br>Jesus, Your name is the highest
<br>Your name is the greatest
<br>Your name stands above them all
<br>All thrones and dominions
<br>All powers and positions
<br>Your name stands above them all
<br><br>And the angels cry, Holy
<br>All creation cries, Holy
<br>You are lifted high, Holy
<br>Holy forever
<br>Hear your people sing, Holy
<br>To the King of Kings, Holy
<br><br>You will always be, Holy
<br>Holy forever

You will always be, Holy
Holy forever

<br><br>**2. Ancient of Days**<br><br>
<br>Though the nations rage
<br>Kingdoms rise and fall
<br>There is still one King
<br>Reigning over all

So I will not fear for this truth remains:
<br>That my God is the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
<br>All of time in His hands
<br>For His throne it shall remain and ever stand

All the power, all the glory
<br>I will trust in His name
<br>For my God is the Ancient of Days

Though the dread of night
<br>Overwhelms my soul
<br>He is here with me
<br>I am not alone

O His love is sure and He knows my name
<br>For my God is the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
<br>All of time in His hands
<br>For His throne it shall remain and ever stand

All the power, all the glory
<br>I will trust in His name
<br>For my God is the Ancient of Days

Though I may not see
<br>What the future brings
<br>I will watch and wait
<br>For the Saviour King

Then my joy complete standing face to face
<br>In the presence of the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
<br>All of time in His hands
<br>For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
<br>All the power, all the glory
<br>I will trust in His name
<br>For my God is the Ancient of Days
<br>For my God is the Ancient of Days

<br><br> **3. You Alone** <br><br>
<br>You alone could light the heavens
<br>Speak, and form the universe
<br>Every grain and galaxy
<br>Abiding by Your word
<br>You alone deserve all glory
<br>In one anthem, joyfully raised
<br>Every language, every tongue
<br>Resounding in Your praise
 
Chorus:
<br>Every nation needs to know
<br>There's salvation in Your name alone
<br>For Your kingdom we must go
<br>To all of the earth, all of the earth
 
You alone could ransom sinners
<br>No one else could pay such price
<br>Give for love Your perfect life
<br>In humble sacrifice
<br>You alone have conquered darkness
<br>Death no longer wields its sting
<br>Raised in power to reign forever
<br>Jesus, King of Kings
 
Chorus:
<br>Every nation needs to know
<br>There's salvation in Your name alone
<br>For Your kingdom we must go
<br>To all of the earth, all of the earth
 
You alone restore the broken
<br>Through the weak display Your power
<br>Strengthen us to persevere
<br>Equip us for this hour
<br>Christ alone our ceaseless message
<br>Grace and peace our overflow
<br>Surely You are always with us
<br>Jesus, we will go
 
Chorus:
<br>Every nation needs to know
<br>There's salvation in Your name alone
<br>For Your kingdom we must go
<br>To all of the earth, all of the earth
 
Every nation needs to know
<br>There's salvation in Your name alone
<br>For Your kingdom we must go
<br>To all of the earth, all of the earth

<br><br> **4. God is Our Strength and Refuge** <br><br>
<br>God is our strength and refuge,
<br>Our present help in trouble;
<br>and we therefore will not fear,
<br>though the earth should change!
<br>Though mountains shake and tremble,
<br>though swirling floods are raging,
<br>God the Lord of hosts is with us evermore!
 
There is a flowing river,
<br>Within God's holy city;
<br>God is in the midst of her -
<br>she shall not be moved!
<br>God's help is swiftly given,
<br>thrones vanish at his presence -
<br>God the Lord of hosts is with us evermore!
 
Come, see the works of our maker,
<br>learn of his His deeds all powerful;
<br>wars will cease across the world
<br>when He shatters the spear!
<br>Be still and know your creator,
<br>uplift Him in the nations -
<br>God the Lord of hosts is with us evermore!
