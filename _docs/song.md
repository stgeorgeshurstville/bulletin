## 9:30am Song Lyrics<br>

### 1. Ancient of Days<br>
Though the nations rage
Kingdoms rise and fall
There is still one King
Reigning over all
So I will not fear for this truth remains:
That my God is the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is the Ancient of Days 

Though the dread of night
Overwhelms my soul
He is here with me
I am not alone
O His love is sure and He knows my name
For my God is the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is the Ancient of Days

Though I may not see
What the future brings
I will watch and wait
For the Saviour King
Then my joy complete standing face to face
In the presence of the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is the Ancient of Days

For my God is the Ancient of Days

### 2. Arise, Shine<br>
Darkness like a shroud covers the earth;
Evil like a cloud covers the people.
But the Lord will rise upon you,
And His glory will appear on you,
Nations will come to your light.

Arise, shine, your light has come,
The glory of the Lord has risen on you!
Arise, shine, your light has come,
Jesus the Light of the world has come.  

Here among us now, Christ the light
Kindles brighter flames in our trembling hearts.
Living Word, our lamp come guide our feet
As we walk as one in light and peace,
Till justice and truth shine like the sun.

Arise, shine, your light has come,
The glory of the Lord has risen on you!
Arise, shine, your light has come,
Jesus the Light of the world has come.

Like a city bright so let us blaze;
Lights in every street turning night to day.
And the darkness shall not overcome
Till the fulness of Christ’s kingdom comes,
Dawning to God’s eternal day. 

Arise, shine, your light has come,
The glory of the Lord has risen on you!
Arise, shine, your light has come,
Jesus the Light of the world
Jesus the Light of the world
Jesus the Light of the world  has come.

### 3. What a Beautiful Name<br>
You were the Word at the beginning
One with God the Lord Most High
Your hidden glory in creation
Now revealed in You our Christ

What a beautiful name it is
What a beautiful name it is
The name of Jesus Christ my King

What a beautiful name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a beautiful name it is
The name of Jesus

You didn't want heaven without us
So Jesus, You brought heaven down
My sin was great, Your love was greater
What could separate us now

What a wonderful name it is
What a wonderful name it is
The name of Jesus Christ my King

What a wonderful name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a wonderful name it is
The name of Jesus

Death could not hold You
The veil tore before You
You silenced the boast, of sin and grave
The heavens are roaring the praise of Your glory
For You are raised to life again

You have no rival
You have no equal
Now and forever, God You reign
Yours is the Kingdom
Yours is the Glory
Yours is the name, above all names

What a powerful name it is
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus Christ my King
What a powerful name it is
Nothing can stand against
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus 

You have no rival
You have no equal
Now and forever, God You reign
Yours is the Kingdom
Yours is the Glory
Yours is the name, above all names

What a powerful name it is
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus Christ my King
What a powerful name it is
Nothing can stand against
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus 

What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus

### 4. 10,000 Reasons<br>
Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy Name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy Name


The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning
It's time to sing Your song again
Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me
Let me be singing when the evening comes


Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy Name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy Name


You're rich in love and You're slow to anger
Your Name is great and Your heart is kind
For all Your goodness I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find


Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy Name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy Name


And on that day when my strength is failing,
The end draws near and my time has come;
Still my soul sings Your praise unending,
Ten thousand years and then forevermore.


Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy Name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy Name 


Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy Name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy Name
Yes I’ll worship Your holy Name
Lord I’ll Worship Your holy Name
