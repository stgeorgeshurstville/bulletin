### 9:30am Song Lyrics
<br><br>**1. Holy Forever**<br><br>
<br>A thousand generations falling down in worship
<br>To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
<br>And all who’ve gone before us and all who will believe
<br>Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb
<br><br>Your name is the highest
<br>Your name is the greatest
<br>Your name stands above them all
<br>All thrones and dominions
<br>All powers and positions
<br>Your name stands above them all
<br><br>And the angels cry, Holy
<br>All creation cries, Holy
<br>You are lifted high, Holy
<br>Holy forever
<br><br>If you’ve been forgiven and if you’ve been redeemed
<br>Sing the song forever to the Lamb
<br>If you walk in freedom and if you bear His name
<br>Sing the song forever to the Lamb
<br>We’ll sing the song forever and amen
<br><br>And the angels cry, Holy
<br>All creation cries, Holy
<br>You are lifted high, Holy
<br>Holy forever
<br><br>Your name is the highest
<br>Your name is the greatest
<br>Your name stands above them all
<br>All thrones and dominions
<br>All powers and positions
<br>Your name stands above them all
<br><br>Jesus, Your name is the highest
<br>Your name is the greatest
<br>Your name stands above them all
<br>All thrones and dominions
<br>All powers and positions
<br>Your name stands above them all
<br><br>And the angels cry, Holy
<br>All creation cries, Holy
<br>You are lifted high, Holy
<br>Holy forever
<br>Hear your people sing, Holy
<br>To the King of Kings, Holy
<br><br>You will always be, Holy
<br>Holy forever

You will always be, Holy
<br>Holy forever

<br><br>**2. Trust & Obey (CXMMXNS)**<br><br>
<br>When we walk with the Lord
<br>In the light of His Word
<br>What a glory He sheds on our way
<br>While we do His good will
<br>He abides with us still
<br>And with all who will trust and obey
<br><br>There's no other way
<br>To be happy in Jesus
<br>With peace in my mind, joy in my heart
<br>I'll take up my cross
<br>For all of my days
<br>I'll do what You say
<br>There's no other way
<br>But to trust and obey
<br><br>Then in fellowship sweet
<br>We will sit at His feet
<br>Or we'll walk by His side in the way
<br>What He says we will do
<br>Where He sends we will go
<br>Never fear, only trust and obey
<br><br>There's no other way
<br>To be happy in Jesus
<br>With peace in my mind, and joy in my heart
<br>I'll take up my cross
<br>For all of my days
<br>I'll do what You say
<br>There's no other way
<br>But to trust and obey
<br><br>I'll trust the Lord
<br>I'll trust the Lord
<br>You will be faithful
<br>Like You've been before
<br><br>Oh, I'll trust You, Lord
<br>Yes, I'll trust You, Lord
<br>Oh, for the grace
<br>To trust You with more
<br><br>I'll trust the Lord
<br>I'll trust the Lord
<br>You will be faithful
<br>Like You've been before
<br><br>Oh, I'll trust You, Lord
<br>Yes, I'll trust You, Lord
<br>Oh, for the grace
<br>To trust You with more
<br><br>There's no other way
<br>To be happy in Jesus
<br>With peace in my mind, and joy in my heart
<br>I'll take up my cross
<br>For all of my days
<br>I'll do what You say
<br>There's no other way
<br>But to trust and obey
<br>I'll do what You say
<br>There's no other way
<br>But to trust and obey
<br><br>Trust and obey
<br>For there's no other way
<br>To be happy in Jesus
<br>But to trust and obey

<br><br> **3. No Other Name** <br><br>
<br>There is no other name 
<br>In heaven can be found 
<br>Through whom we are redeemed 
<br>Through whom your grace abounds 
<br>No other name can save 
<br>But Jesus Christ our Lord 
<br><br>My joy in sorrowʼs tears 
<br>My strength to cast out fears 
<br>No other name but Jesus, Jesus 
<br>My hope in darkest night 
<br>My broken soulʼs delight 
<br>No other name but Jesus, Jesus 
<br><br>There is no victory 
<br>But Jesus crucified 
<br>No other cure for sin 
<br>But that our Saviour died 
<br>No other hope we have 
<br>But that he rose again 
<br><br>My joy in sorrowʼs tears 
<br>My strength to cast out fears 
<br>No other name but Jesus, Jesus 
<br>My hope in darkest night 
<br>My broken soulʼs delight 
<br>No other name but Jesus, Jesus 
<br><br>No other throne endures 
<br>No other song remains 
<br>But ʻWorthy is the Lamb 
<br>Who was for sinners slainʼ 
<br>When every knee shall bow 
<br>And tongue confess you are Lord, 
<br>You are Lord
<br><br>My joy in sorrowʼs tears 
<br>My strength to cast out fears 
<br>No other name but Jesus, Jesus 
<br>My hope in darkest night 
<br>My broken soulʼs delight 
<br>No other name but Jesus, Jesus

<br><br> **4. Psalm 90** <br><br>
<br>Teach us to number our days
<br>That we might have wise hearts
<br>Grass wither flowers will fade
<br>Your word alone will last
<br><br>Do not store up here, things that wont last
<br>Where your treasure is, there is your heart
<br><br>Teach us to number our days
<br>That we might have wise hearts
<br>Grass wither flowers will fade
<br>Your word alone will last
<br><br>Seek and strive, put first the Kingdom of God 
<br>All else that you need He will provide 
<br><br>Teach us to number our days
<br>That we might have wise hearts
<br>Grass wither flowers will fade
<br>Your word alone will last
<br><br>Pain and struggle now, will not compare 
<br>To the glory then, we will all share
<br><br>Teach us to number our days
<br>That we might have wise hearts
<br>Grass wither flowers will fade
<br>Your word alone will last
<br><br>Your word alone will last
