## 9:30am Song Lyrics<br>

### 1. Ancient of Days<br>
Though the nations rage
Kingdoms rise and fall
There is still one King
Reigning over all
So I will not fear for this truth remains:
That my God is the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is the Ancient of Days 

Though the dread of night
Overwhelms my soul
He is here with me
I am not alone
O His love is sure and He knows my name
For my God is the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is the Ancient of Days

Though I may not see
What the future brings
I will watch and wait
For the Saviour King
Then my joy complete standing face to face
In the presence of the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is the Ancient of Days

For my God is the Ancient of Days

### 2. Arise, Shine<br>
Darkness like a shroud covers the earth;
Evil like a cloud covers the people.
But the Lord will rise upon you,
And His glory will appear on you,
Nations will come to your light.

Arise, shine, your light has come,
The glory of the Lord has risen on you!
Arise, shine, your light has come,
Jesus the Light of the world has come.  

Here among us now, Christ the light
Kindles brighter flames in our trembling hearts.
Living Word, our lamp come guide our feet
As we walk as one in light and peace,
Till justice and truth shine like the sun.

Arise, shine, your light has come,
The glory of the Lord has risen on you!
Arise, shine, your light has come,
Jesus the Light of the world has come.

Like a city bright so let us blaze;
Lights in every street turning night to day.
And the darkness shall not overcome
Till the fulness of Christ’s kingdom comes,
Dawning to God’s eternal day. 

Arise, shine, your light has come,
The glory of the Lord has risen on you!
Arise, shine, your light has come,
Jesus the Light of the world
Jesus the Light of the world
Jesus the Light of the world  has come.

### 3. King of Kings<br>
In the darkness we were waiting
Without hope, without light
'Til from Heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes
To fulfill the law and prophets
To a virgin came the word
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt

Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
For even in your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake you died 

Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

And the morning that You rose
All of Heaven held its breath
'Til that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who'd come
To the Father are restored 

And the church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel, shall not faint
By His blood and in His name
In His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me 

Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings
Praise forever to the King of Kings

### 4. You Alone<br>
You alone could light the heavens
Speak, and form the universe
Every grain and galaxy
Abiding by Your word
You alone deserve all glory
In one anthem, joyfully raised
Every language, every tongue
Resounding in Your praise

Every nation needs to know
There's salvation in Your name alone
For Your kingdom we must go
To all of the earth, all of the earth
  
You alone could ransom sinners
No one else could pay such price
Give for love Your perfect life
In humble sacrifice
You alone have conquered darkness
Death no longer wields its sting
Raised in power to reign forever
Jesus, King of Kings
  
Every nation needs to know
There's salvation in Your name alone
For Your kingdom we must go
To all of the earth, all of the earth

You alone restore the broken
Through the weak display Your power
Strengthen us to persevere
Equip us for this hour
Christ alone our ceaseless message
Grace and peace our overflow
Surely You are always with us
Jesus, we will go

Every nation needs to know
There's salvation in Your name alone
For Your kingdom we must go
To all of the earth, all of the earth

Every nation needs to know
There's salvation in Your name alone
For Your kingdom we must go
To all of the earth, all of the earth
