1. **What an Awesome God**

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom, power, and love
Our God is an awesome God

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom, power, and love
Our God is an awesome God

God is great
Give Him all the praise
Hallelujah, Name above all Names
Fire in His eyes
Healing in His veins
Everywhere, His glory on display

Take a look at those stars
He can name them all
Before His throne, every knee falls
The demons have to run
The angels have to praise
Even the wind and waves obey

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom, power, and love
Our God is an awesome God

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom, power, and love
Our God is an awesome God

And even when I ran
He didn't run away
He came and put death back in its place
Friday on a cross
Broken for my shame
Sunday morning rose up from that grave

Take a look at those scars on His hands and feet
He saved our souls for eternity
Worthy is the Lamb
Glory to the King
Oh, let all the saints and the angels sing

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom, power, and love
Our God is an awesome God

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom, power, and love
Our God is an awesome God

Eyes on the Sky
There will be a day
He will come and wipe our tears away
No more fear
No more pain
No more sorrow, sin, or shame

The King is coming back again
A reign of love that will never end
For everything You've done
And everything You do
And everything You are I'll sing to you

My God, You're an awesome God
You're great in all You do
I'm made to worship You
My God, You're an awesome God

My God, You're an awesome God
You're great in all You do
I'm made to worship You
My God, You're an awesome God

2. **Awesome God**

When He rolls up His sleeves
He ain't just puttin' on the Ritz
(Our God is an awesome God)

There's thunder in His footsteps
And lightning in His fists
(Our God is an awesome God)

Well the Lord wasn't jokin'
When He kicked 'em out of Eden
It wasn't for no reason that He shed His blood
His return is very close so you better be believin'
That our God is an awesome God

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom and power and love
Our God is an awesome God

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom and power and love
Our God is an awesome God

When the sky was starless in the void of the night
(Our God is an awesome God)

He spoke into the darkness and created the light
(Our God is an awesome God)

Judgement and wrath He poured out on Sodom
Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross
I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten that
Our God is an awesome God

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom and power and love
Our God is an awesome God

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom and power and love
Our God is an awesome God

Our God is an awesome God

Our God is an awesome God

3. **How Deep the Father's Love for us**
   
How deep the Father's love for us,
How vast beyond all measure!
That He should give His only Son,
To make a wretch His treasure.

How great the pain of searing loss!
The Father turns His face away;
As wounds which marred the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory.

Behold the man upon a cross:
My sin upon His shoulders;
Ashamed I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers.

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished;
His dying breath has brought me life:
I know that it is finished.

I will not boast in anything:
No gifts, no power, no wisdom;
But I will boast in Jesus Christ:
His death and resurrection.

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer;
But this I know with all my heart:
His wounds have paid my ransom

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer;
But this I know with all my heart:
His wounds have paid my ransom

His wounds have paid my ransom.

4. **By Faith**

By faith we see the hand of God
In the light of creation′s grand design
In the lives of those who prove His faithfulness
Who walk by faith and not by sight

By faith our fathers roamed the earth
With the power of His promise in their hearts
Of a holy city built by God's own hand
A place where peace and justice reign

We will stand as children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul′s reward
'Til the race is finished and the work is done
We'll walk by faith and not by sight

By faith the prophets saw a day
When the longed-for Messiah would appear
With the pow′r to break the chains of sin and death
And rise triumphant from the grave

By faith the church was called to go
In the pow′r of the Spirit to the lost
To deliver captives and to preach good news
In every corner of the earth

We will stand as children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward
′Til the race is finished and the work is done
We'll walk by faith and not by sight

By faith this mountain shall be moved
And the power of the gospel shall prevail
For we know in Christ all things are possible
For all who call upon His name

We will stand as children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul′s reward
'Til the race is finished and the work is done
We′ll walk by faith and not by sight

We will stand as children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul′s reward
'Til the race is finished and the work is done
We′ll walk by faith and not by sight
We′ll walk by faith and not by sight
