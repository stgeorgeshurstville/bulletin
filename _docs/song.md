## 9:30am Song Lyrics<br>

### 1. How Great is our God<br>
The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty<br>
Let all the earth rejoice<br>
All the earth rejoice<br>

He wraps himself in Light<br>
And darkness tries to hide<br>
And trembles at His voice<br>
Trembles at His voice<br>


How great is our God, sing with me<br>
How great is our God, and all will see<br>
How great, how great is our God<br>

Age to age He stands<br>
And time is in His hands<br>
Beginning and the end<br>
Beginning and the end<br>

The Godhead Three in One<br>
Father Spirit Son<br>
The Lion and the Lamb<br>
The Lion and the Lamb<br>

How great is our God, sing with me<br>
How great is our God, and all will see<br>
How great, how great is our God<br>


Name above all names<br>
Worthy of our praise<br>
My heart will sing<br>
How great is our God<br>

Name above all names<br>
Worthy of our praise<br>
My heart will sing<br>
How great is our God<br>


How great is our God, sing with me<br>
How great is our God, and all will see<br>
How great, how great is our God<br>


### 2. O Praise the Name<br>
I cast my mind to Calvary<br>
Where Jesus bled and died for me<br>
I see His wounds, His hands, His feet<br>
My Saviour on that cursed tree<br>

His body bound and drenched in tears<br>
They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb<br>
The entrance sealed by heavy stone<br>
Messiah still and all alone<br>


O praise the name of the Lord our God<br>
O praise His name forever more<br>
For endless days we will sing Your praise<br>
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God<br>


And then on the third at break of dawn<br>
The Son of heaven rose again<br>
O trampled death where is your sting<br>
The angels roar for Christ the King<br>

O praise the name of the Lord our God<br>
O praise His name forever more<br>
For endless days we will sing Your praise<br>
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God<br>


He shall return in robes of white<br>
The blazing Son shall pierce the night<br>
And I will rise among the saints<br>
My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face<br>
O praise the name of the Lord our God<br>
O praise His name forever more<br>
For endless days we will sing Your praise<br>
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God<br>
O praise the name of the Lord our God<br>
O praise His name forever more<br>
For endless days we will sing Your praise<br>
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God<br>

Oh Lord, oh Lord our God<br>
