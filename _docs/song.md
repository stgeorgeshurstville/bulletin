### 9:30am Song Lyrics
<br><br>**1. Only By Grace**<br><br>
Only by grace can we enter  
Only by grace can we stand  
Not by our human endeavour  
But by the blood of the Lamb  
Into Your presence You call us  
You call us to come  
Into Your presence You draw us   
And now by Your grace we come  
And now by Your grace we come  

Lord if You marked our transgressions  
who would stand  
Thanks to Your grace we are cleansed  
by the blood of the Lamb  
Lord if You marked our transgressions  
who would stand  
Thanks to Your grace we are cleansed  
by the blood of the Lamb  
 
Only by grace can we enter  
Only by grace can we stand  
Not by our human endeavour  
But by the blood of the Lamb  
Into Your presence You call us  
You call us to come  
Into Your presence You draw us  
And now by Your grace we come  
And now by Your grace we come

<br><br>**2. Cornerstone**<br><br>
My hope is built on nothing less  
Than Jesus blood and righteousness  
I dare not trust the sweetest frame  
But wholly trust in Jesus name  
My hope is built on nothing less  
Than Jesus blood and righteousness  
I dare not trust the sweetest frame  
But wholly trust in Jesus name  

Christ alone, Cornerstone  
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love  
Through the storm, He is Lord  
Lord of all  

When darkness seems to hide His face  
I rest on His unchanging grace  
In every high and stormy gale  
My anchor holds within the veil  
My anchor holds within the veil  

Christ alone, Cornerstone  
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love  
Through the storm, He is Lord  
Lord of all  
He is Lord, Lord of all  

Christ alone, Cornerstone  
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love  
Through the storm, He is Lord  
Lord of all  

Christ alone, Cornerstone  
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love  
Through the storm, He is Lord  
Lord of all  

When He shall come with trumpet sound  
Oh may I then in Him be found  
Dressed in His righteousness alone  
Faultless stand before the throne  

Christ alone, Cornerstone  
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love  
Through the storm, He is Lord  
Lord of all  

Christ alone, Cornerstone  
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love  
Through the storm, He is Lord  
Lord of all

<br><br>**3. Have Mercy on Me**<br><br>
I am a sinner; You’re blameless, Lord    
My sins against You can’t be ignored  
They will be punished, I know they must  
Your law demands it, for You are just  

If You would count  
Everything that I’ve done wrong  
Who could stand?  
But there’s forgiveness with You, God  

Have mercy on me, have mercy on me  
A broken and a contrite heart  
You won’t turn away  
Have mercy on me, have mercy on me  
Because of Your steadfast love  

Father of mercy, You gave Your Son  
To make atonement for wrongs I have done   
What You required, Jesus fulfilled  
I don’t deserve it— I never will  

If You would count  
Everything that I’ve done wrong    
Who could stand?  
But there’s forgiveness with You, God  

Have mercy on me, have mercy on me  
A broken and a contrite heart  
You won’t turn away  
Have mercy on me, have mercy on me  
Because of Your steadfast love

<br><br> **4. Creation Awaits** <br><br>
I am alive, saved by Your sacrifice  
Death overcome, glory dispels the night  
You call the lifeless to wake from death to life  
Out of darkness arise  
I am set free, saved from the power of sin  
Guilt, overcome, Your Spirit at work within  
You break the chains of the law, I am released  
From the burden of sin  

Now we cry, "Father, " we are Your children  
We are adopted as Your own  
No condemnation, we are forgiven  
Nothing can take us from Your love  

I am redeemed, raised with my saviour Christ  
Fear, overcome, I will be glorified  
You will forever defend and stand beside  
I am safe in Your love  
 
Now we cry, "Father, " we are Your children  
We are adopted as Your own  
No condemnation, we are forgiven  
Nothing can take us from Your love  

Creation awaits the glorious day  
When Jesus returns and trials will fade  
Creation awaits the glorious day  
When Jesus returns and trials will fade  
 
Now we cry, "Father, " we are Your children  
We are adopted as Your own  
No condemnation, we are forgiven  
Nothing can take us from Your love  

Creation awaits the glorious day  
When Jesus returns and trials will fade  
Creation awaits the glorious day  
When Jesus returns and trials will fade
