### 9:30am Song Lyrics
<br><br>**1. Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing**<br><br>
Come, thou Fount of every blessing,
tune my heart to sing thy grace;
streams of mercy, never ceasing,
call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
sung by flaming tongues above.
Praise the mount! I’m fixed upon it,
mount of God’s redeeming love

Here I raise my Ebenezer;
hither by thy help I’ve come;
and I hope, by thy good pleasure,
safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
wandering from the fold of God;
he, to rescue me from danger,
interposed his precious blood.

O to grace how great a debtor
daily I’m constrained to be!
Let thy goodness, like a fetter,
bind my wandering heart to thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
prone to leave the God I love;
here’s my heart, O take and seal it,
seal it for thy courts above.

<br><br>**2. Shout to the Lord**<br><br>
My Jesus, my Saviour
Lord there is none like You
All of my days I want to praise
The wonders of Your mighty love

My comfort, my shelter
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath, all that I am
Never cease to worship You

Shout to the Lord all the Earth, let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the King
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
At the sound of Your name

I sing for joy at the work of Your hands
Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand
Nothing compares to the promise I have In You

My Jesus, my Saviour
Lord there is none like You
All of my days I want to praise
The wonders of Your mighty love

My comfort, my shelter
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath, all that I am
Never cease to worship You

Shout to the Lord all the Earth, let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the King
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
At the sound of Your name

I sing for joy at the work of Your hands
Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand
Nothing compares to the promise I have In You

<br><br> **3. See Him Coming** <br><br>
Glory and power to the One who loves us
Honour and praise him forever
Come Lord Jesus, Come Lord Jesus

Glory and power to the One who freed us
From all our sins by his blood
Come Lord Jesus, Come Lord Jesus

See him coming on the clouds of heaven
Every eye behold him now
He’s the Living One the first and last
Who once was dead, but now he lives
forever and ever

Glory and power to the One who made us
A kingdom of priests for God’s service
Come Lord Jesus, Come Lord Jesus

See him coming on the clouds of heaven
Every eye behold him now
He’s the Living One the first and last
Who once was dead, but now he lives
forever and ever

Jesus is the living one
Who died and came alive
Jesus is Almighty Lord
Who was, and is to come!

Jesus is the living one
Who died and came alive
Jesus is Almighty Lord
Who was, and is to come!

See him coming on the clouds of heaven
Every eye behold him now
He’s the Living One the first and last
Who once was dead, but now he lives

See him coming on the clouds of heaven
Every eye behold him now
He’s the Living One the first and last
Who once was dead, but now he lives
forever and ever
forever and ever

<br><br> **4. Is He Worthy** <br><br>
Do you feel the world is broken? (We do)
Do you feel the shadows deepen? (We do)
But do you know that all the dark won't
stop the light from getting through? (We do)
Do you wish that you could see it all made new? (We do)

Is all creation groaning? (It is)
Is a new creation coming? (It is)
Is the glory of the Lord to be the light within our midst? (It is)
Is it good that we remind ourselves of this? (It is)

Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He is David's root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave

Is He worthy? Is He worthy
Of all blessing and honor and glory?
Is He worthy of this?
He is

Does the Father truly love us? (He does)
Does the Spirit move among us? (He does)
And does Jesus, our Messiah, hold forever those He loves? (He does)
Does our God intend to dwell again with us? (He does)

Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He is David's root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave
From every people and tribe
Every nation and tongue
He has made us a kingdom and priests to God
To reign with the Son

Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory?
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Is He worthy of this?
He is, He is
He is, He is

He is worthy! He is worthy!
Of all blessing and honor and glory
He is worthy of this
He is
