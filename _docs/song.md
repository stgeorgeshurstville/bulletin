### 9:30am Song Lyrics
<br><br>**1. Holy Forever**<br><br>
<br>The splendour of a King, clothed in majesty
<br>Let all the Earth rejoice
<br>All the Earth rejoice

He wraps himself in light
<br>And darkness tries to hide
<br>And trembles at His voice
<br>Trembles at His voice
 
How great is our God, sing with me
<br>How great is our God, and all will see
<br>How great, how great is our God
 
Age to age He stands
<br>And time is in His hands
<br>Beginning and the end
<br>Beginning and the end
 
The Godhead Three in One
<br>Father Spirit Son
<br>The Lion and the Lamb
<br>The Lion and the Lamb
 
How great is our God, sing with me
<br>How great is our God, and all will see
<br>How great, how great is our God
 
Name above all names 
<br>Worthy of our praise 
<br>My heart will sing
<br>How great is our God
 
Name above all names 
<br>You are worthy of our praise 
<br>And my heart will sing
<br>How great is our God
 
How great is our God, sing with me
<br>How great is our God, and all will see
<br>How great, how great is our God

<br><br>**2. Ancient of Days**<br><br>
<br>Though the nations rage
<br>Kingdoms rise and fall
<br>There is still one King
<br>Reigning over all

So I will not fear for this truth remains:
<br>That my God is the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
<br>All of time in His hands
<br>For His throne it shall remain and ever stand

All the power, all the glory
<br>I will trust in His name
<br>For my God is the Ancient of Days

Though the dread of night
<br>Overwhelms my soul
<br>He is here with me
<br>I am not alone

O His love is sure and He knows my name
<br>For my God is the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
<br>All of time in His hands
<br>For His throne it shall remain and ever stand

All the power, all the glory
<br>I will trust in His name
<br>For my God is the Ancient of Days

Though I may not see
<br>What the future brings
<br>I will watch and wait
<br>For the Saviour King

Then my joy complete standing face to face
<br>In the presence of the Ancient of Days

None above Him, none before Him
<br>All of time in His hands
<br>For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
<br>All the power, all the glory
<br>I will trust in His name
<br>For my God is the Ancient of Days
<br>For my God is the Ancient of Days

<br><br> **3. You Alone** <br><br>
<br>You alone could light the heavens
<br>Speak, and form the universe
<br>Every grain and galaxy
<br>Abiding by Your word
<br>You alone deserve all glory
<br>In one anthem, joyfully raised
<br>Every language, every tongue
<br>Resounding in Your praise
 
Chorus:
<br>Every nation needs to know
<br>There's salvation in Your name alone
<br>For Your kingdom we must go
<br>To all of the earth, all of the earth
 
You alone could ransom sinners
<br>No one else could pay such price
<br>Give for love Your perfect life
<br>In humble sacrifice
<br>You alone have conquered darkness
<br>Death no longer wields its sting
<br>Raised in power to reign forever
<br>Jesus, King of Kings
 
Chorus:
<br>Every nation needs to know
<br>There's salvation in Your name alone
<br>For Your kingdom we must go
<br>To all of the earth, all of the earth
 
You alone restore the broken
<br>Through the weak display Your power
<br>Strengthen us to persevere
<br>Equip us for this hour
<br>Christ alone our ceaseless message
<br>Grace and peace our overflow
<br>Surely You are always with us
<br>Jesus, we will go
 
Chorus:
<br>Every nation needs to know
<br>There's salvation in Your name alone
<br>For Your kingdom we must go
<br>To all of the earth, all of the earth
 
Every nation needs to know
<br>There's salvation in Your name alone
<br>For Your kingdom we must go
<br>To all of the earth, all of the earth

<br><br> **4. God is Our Strength and Refuge** <br><br>
<br>God is our strength and refuge,
<br>Our present help in trouble;
<br>and we therefore will not fear,
<br>though the earth should change!
<br>Though mountains shake and tremble,
<br>though swirling floods are raging,
<br>God the Lord of hosts is with us evermore!
 
There is a flowing river,
<br>Within God's holy city;
<br>God is in the midst of her -
<br>she shall not be moved!
<br>God's help is swiftly given,
<br>thrones vanish at his presence -
<br>God the Lord of hosts is with us evermore!
 
Come, see the works of our maker,
<br>learn of his His deeds all powerful;
<br>wars will cease across the world
<br>when He shatters the spear!
<br>Be still and know your creator,
<br>uplift Him in the nations -
<br>God the Lord of hosts is with us evermore!
