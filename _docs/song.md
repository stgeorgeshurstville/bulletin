Let all things their Creator bless<br>
And worship Him in humbleness<br>

O praise Him! O praise Him!<br>
Alleluia! Alleluia! Allelu - ia!<br><br>

All the Redeemed washed by His blood<br>
Come and rejoice in His great love<br>

Come let us adore Him<br>
Behold our King, nothing can compare, <br>
Come let us adore Him!<br><br>

Bearing all the guilt of sinful man?<br>
God eternal, humbled to the grave<br>

Thy pow’r and Thine alone<br>
Can change the leper’s spots<br>

He washed it white as snow<br><br>

And raised this life up from the dead (x6)<br><br>
