### 9:30am Song Lyrics
<br><br>**1. Worthy is the Lamb**<br><br>
Thank you for the cross, Lord
<br>Thank you for the price You paid
<br>Bearing all my sin and shame
<br>In love You came
<br>And gave amazing grace
<br><br>Thank you for this love, Lord
<br>Thank you for the nail pierced hands
<br>Washed me in Your cleansing flow
<br>Now all I know
<br>Your forgiveness and embrace
<br><br>Worthy is the Lamb
<br>Seated on the throne
<br>Crown You now with many crowns
<br>You reign victorious
<br><br>High and lifted up
<br>Jesus Son of God
<br>The Darling of Heaven crucified
<br>Worthy is the Lamb
<br>Worthy is the Lamb
<br><br>Thank you for the cross, Lord
<br>Thank you for the price You paid
<br>Bearing all my sin and shame
<br>In love You came
<br>And gave amazing grace
<br><br>Thank you for this love, Lord
<br>Thank you for the nail pierced hands
<br>Washed me in Your cleansing flow
<br>Now all I know
<br>Your forgiveness and embrace
<br><br>Worthy is the Lamb
<br>Seated on the throne
<br>Crown You now with many crowns
<br>You reign victorious
<br><br>High and lifted up
<br>Jesus Son of God
<br>The Darling of Heaven crucified
<br>Worthy is the Lamb
<br>Worthy is the Lamb
<br>Worthy is the Lamb
<br>Worthy is the Lamb
<br><br>Worthy is the Lamb
<br>Seated on the throne
<br>Crown You now with many crowns
<br>You reign victorious
<br><br>High and lifted up
<br>Jesus Son of God
<br>The Darling of Heaven crucified
<br>Worthy is the Lamb
<br>Worthy is the Lamb
<br>Worthy is the Lamb

<br><br>**2. Your Word**<br><br>
<br>Your word is good, it′s ever faithful
<br>Worth more than gold, the heart's delight
<br>Your word gives life to all who hear and obey
<br>Your word endures forever
<br><br>Your word is true, it never changes
<br>It formed the earth; sustains it still
<br>Your word defends, providing refuge and strength
<br>Your word endures forever
<br><br>Your word is a lamp unto my feet
<br>Your word is a light unto my path
<br>For your word is my hope, it′s my joy and my song
<br>Your word endures forever
<br><br>Your word transforms, it lifts the humble
<br>Rebukes the proud, protects the poor
<br>Your word discerns the mind and spirit of all
<br>Your word endures forever
<br><br>Your word is a lamp unto my feet
<br>Your word is a light unto my path
<br>For your word is my hope, it's my joy and my song
<br>Your word endures forever
<br><br>Your word is more than just letters on pages
<br>It's life and it′s love and it′s freedom for us
<br>Your word is more than just wisdom of ages;
<br>Its treasures are endless, it's always enough
<br>Your word is more than just stories of old;
<br>It′s the truth and the way and the story of love
<br>Your word is more than just breath into dust;
<br>It's your Son, as a man, come to dwell here with us
<br><br>Your word is a lamp unto my feet
<br>Your word is a light unto my path
<br>For your word is my hope, it′s my joy and my song
<br>Your word endures forever
<br>Your word endures forever
<br>Your word endures forever

<br><br> **3. Behold Our God** <br><br>
<br>Who has held the oceans in his hands?
<br>Who has numbered every grain of sand?
<br>Kings and nations tremble at his voice
<br>All creation rises to rejoice
<br><br>Behold our God, seated on his throne
<br>Come, let us adore him
<br>Behold our king, nothing can compare
<br>Come, let us adore him
<br><br>Who has given counsel to the Lord?
<br>Who can question any of his words?
<br>Who can teach, the one who knows all things?
<br>Who can fathom all his wondrous deeds?
<br><br>Behold our God, seated on his throne
<br>Come, let us adore him
<br>Behold our king, nothing can compare
<br>Come, let us adore him
<br><br>Who has felt the nails upon his hands?
<br>Bearing all the guilt of sinful man
<br>God eternal, humbled to the grave
<br>Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign
<br><br>Behold our God, seated on his throne
<br>Come, let us adore him
<br>Behold our king, nothing can compare
<br>Come, let us adore him
<br>You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
<br>You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
<br>You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
<br>You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
<br><br>You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
<br>You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
<br>You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
<br>You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
<br><br>Behold our God, seated on his throne
<br>Come, let us adore him
<br>Behold our king, nothing can compare
<br>Come, let us adore
<br><br>Behold our God, seated on his throne
<br>Come, let us adore him
<br>Behold our king, nothing can compare
<br>Come, let us adore him

<br><br> **4. Never Once** <br><br>
<br>Standing on this mountaintop
<br>Looking just how far we've come
<br>Knowing that for every step
<br>You were with us
<br><br>Kneeling on this battle ground
<br>Seeing just how much You've done
<br>Knowing every victory
<br>Was Your power in us
<br><br>Scars and struggles on the way
<br>But with joy our hearts can say
<br>Yes, our hearts can say
<br><br>Never once did we ever walk alone
<br>Never once did You leave us on our own
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br><br>Kneeling on this battle ground
<br>Seeing just how much You've done
<br>Knowing every victory
<br>Was Your power in us
<br><br>Scars and struggles on the way
<br>But with joy our hearts can say
<br>Yes, our hearts can say
<br><br>Never once did we ever walk alone
<br>Never once did You leave us on our own
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br><br>Scars and struggles on the way
<br>But with joy our hearts can say
<br>Never once did we ever walk alone
<br>Carried by Your constant grace
<br>Held within Your perfect peace
<br>Never once, no, we never walk alone
<br><br>Never once did we ever walk alone
<br>Never once did You leave us on our own
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br>Every step we are breathing in Your grace
<br>Evermore we'll be breathing out Your praise
<br><br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br>Your are, You are faithful, God, You are faithful
