## 9:30am Song Lyrics<br>

### 1. Shout to the Lord / Worthy is the Lamb<br>
My Jesus, my Savior<br>
Lord there is none like You<br>
All of my days, I want to praise<br>
The wonders of Your mighty love<br>
My Comfort, my Shelter<br>
Tower of Refuge and Strength<br>
Let every breath, all that I am<br>
Never cease to worship You<br><br>

Shout to the Lord All the earth let us sing<br>
Power and majesty Praise to the King<br>
Mountains bow down And the sea will roar<br>
At the sound of Your Name<br>
I sing for joy at the work of Your hands<br>
Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand<br>
Nothing compares to The promise I have in You.<br><br>

My Jesus, my Savior<br>
Lord there is none like You<br>
All of my days, I want to praise<br>
The wonders of Your mighty love<br>
My Comfort, my Shelter<br>
Tower of Refuge and Strength<br>
Let every breath, all that I am<br>
Never cease to worship You<br><br>

Shout to the Lord All the earth let us sing<br>
Power and majesty Praise to the King<br>
Mountains bow down And the sea will roar<br>
At the sound of Your Name<br>
I sing for joy at the work of Your hands<br>
Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand<br>
Nothing compares to The promise I have in You.<br><br>

Thank you for the cross, Lord<br>
Thank you for the price You paid<br>
Bearing all my sin and shame<br>
In love You came<br>
And gave amazing grace<br><br>

Thank you for this love, Lord<br>
Thank you for the nail pierced hands<br>
Washed me in Your cleansing flow<br>
Now all I know<br>
Your forgiveness and embrace<br><br>

Worthy is the Lamb<br>
Seated on the throne<br>
Crown You now with many crowns<br>
You reign victorious<br><br>

High and lifted up<br>
Jesus Son of God<br>
The Darling of Heaven crucified<br>
Worthy is the Lamb<br>
Worthy is the Lamb<br><br>

Worthy is the Lamb<br>
Seated on the throne<br>
Crown You now with many crowns<br>
You reign victorious<br>

High and lifted up<br>
Jesus Son of God<br>
The Darling of Heaven crucified<br>
Worthy is the Lamb<br>
Worthy is the Lamb<br><br>

### 2. Knowing You Jesust<br>
All I once held dear, built my life upon<br>
All this world reveres, and wars to own<br>
All I once thought gain I have counted loss<br>
Spent and worthless now, compared to this<br><br>

Knowing You, Jesus<br>
Knowing You<br>
There is no greater thing<br>
You're my all, You're the best<br>
You're my joy, my righteousness<br>
And I love You, Lord<br><br>

Now my heart's desire is to know You more<br>
To be found in You and known as Yours<br>
To possess by faith what I could not earn<br>
All surpassing gift of righteousness<br><br>

Knowing You, Jesus<br>
Knowing You<br>
There is no greater thing<br>
You're my all, You're the best<br>
You're my joy, my righteousness<br>
And I love You, Lord<br><br>

Oh, to know the power of Your risen life<br>
And to know You in Your sufferings<br>
To become like You in Your death, my Lord<br>
So with You to live and never die<br><br>

Knowing You, Jesus<br>
Knowing You<br>
There is no greater thing<br>
You're my all, You're the best<br>
You're my joy, my righteousness<br>
And I love You, Lord<br><br>

### 3.King of Kings<br>
In the darkness we were waiting<br>
Without hope, without light<br>
'Til from Heaven You came running<br>
There was mercy in Your eyes<br><br>

To fulfill the law and prophets<br>
To a virgin came the word<br>
From a throne of endless glory<br>
To a cradle in the dirt<br><br>

Praise the Father, praise the Son<br>
Praise the Spirit, three in one<br>
God of glory, Majesty<br>
Praise forever to the King of Kings<br><br>

To reveal the kingdom coming<br>
And to reconcile the lost<br>
To redeem the whole creation<br>
You did not despise the cross<br><br>

For even in your suffering<br>
You saw to the other side<br>
Knowing this was our salvation<br>
Jesus for our sake you died<br><br>

Praise the Father, praise the Son<br>
Praise the Spirit, three in one<br>
God of glory, Majesty<br>
Praise forever to the King of Kings<br><br>

And the morning that You rose<br>
All of Heaven held its breath<br>
'Til that stone was moved for good<br>
For the Lamb had conquered death<br><br>

And the dead rose from their tombs<br>
And the angels stood in awe<br>
For the souls of all who'd come<br>
To the Father are restored<br><br>

And the church of Christ was born<br>
Then the Spirit lit the flame<br>
Now this gospel truth of old<br><br>
Shall not kneel, shall not faint<br><br>

By His blood and in His name<br>
In His freedom I am free<br>
For the love of Jesus Christ<br>
Who has resurrected me<br><br>

Praise the Father, praise the Son<br>
Praise the Spirit, three in one<br>
God of glory, Majesty<br>
Praise forever to the King of Kings<br>
Praise forever to the King of Kings<br><br>
