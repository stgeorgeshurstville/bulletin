## 9:30am Song Lyrics<br>

### 1. Before The Throne of God Above<br>
Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
A great High Priest whose name is love
Who ever lives and pleads for me

My name is graven on His hands
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heav’n He stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart

When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end to all my sin

Because the sinless Savior died
My sinful soul is counted free
For God the Just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me
To look on Him and pardon me

Behold Him there, the risen Lamb
My perfect, spotless Righteousness
The great unchangeable I AM
The King of glory and of grace

One with Himself, I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high
With Christ my Savior and my God 
With Christ my Savior and my God

### 2. In Christ Alone<br>
In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This Cornerstone, this solid Ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

And as He stands in victory
Sin’s curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine 
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life’s first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I’ll stand

### 3. What a Beautiful Name<br>
You were the Word at the beginning
One with God the Lord Most High
Your hidden glory in creation
Now revealed in You our Christ

What a beautiful name it is
What a beautiful name it is
The name of Jesus Christ my King

What a beautiful name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a beautiful name it is
The name of Jesus

You didn't want heaven without us
So Jesus, You brought heaven down
My sin was great, Your love was greater
What could separate us now

What a wonderful name it is
What a wonderful name it is
The name of Jesus Christ my King

What a wonderful name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a wonderful name it is
The name of Jesus

Death could not hold You
The veil tore before You
You silenced the boast, of sin and grave
The heavens are roaring the praise of Your glory
For You are raised to life again

You have no rival
You have no equal
Now and forever, God You reign
Yours is the Kingdom
Yours is the Glory
Yours is the name, above all names

What a powerful name it is
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus Christ my King
What a powerful name it is
Nothing can stand against
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus 

You have no rival
You have no equal
Now and forever, God You reign
Yours is the Kingdom
Yours is the Glory
Yours is the name, above all names

What a powerful name it is
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus Christ my King
What a powerful name it is
Nothing can stand against
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus 

What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus

### 4. 10,000 Reasons<br>
Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy Name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy Name


The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning
It's time to sing Your song again
Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me
Let me be singing when the evening comes


Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy Name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy Name


You're rich in love and You're slow to anger
Your Name is great and Your heart is kind
For all Your goodness I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find


Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy Name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy Name


And on that day when my strength is failing,
The end draws near and my time has come;
Still my soul sings Your praise unending,
Ten thousand years and then forevermore.


Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy Name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy Name 


Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy Name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy Name
Yes I’ll worship Your holy Name
Lord I’ll Worship Your holy Name
