## 9:30am Song Lyrics<br>

### 1. How Great is our God<br>
The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty<br>
Let all the earth rejoice<br>
All the earth rejoice<br>

He wraps himself in Light<br>
And darkness tries to hide<br>
And trembles at His voice<br>
Trembles at His voice<br>


How great is our God, sing with me<br>
How great is our God, and all will see<br>
How great, how great is our God<br>

Age to age He stands<br>
And time is in His hands<br>
Beginning and the end<br>
Beginning and the end<br>

The Godhead Three in One<br>
Father Spirit Son<br>
The Lion and the Lamb<br>
The Lion and the Lamb<br>

How great is our God, sing with me<br>
How great is our God, and all will see<br>
How great, how great is our God<br>


Name above all names<br>
Worthy of our praise<br>
My heart will sing<br>
How great is our God<br>

Name above all names<br>
Worthy of our praise<br>
My heart will sing<br>
How great is our God<br>


How great is our God, sing with me<br>
How great is our God, and all will see<br>
How great, how great is our God<br>


### 2. O Praise the Name<br>
I cast my mind to Calvary<br>
Where Jesus bled and died for me<br>
I see His wounds, His hands, His feet<br>
My Saviour on that cursed tree<br>

His body bound and drenched in tears<br>
They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb<br>
The entrance sealed by heavy stone<br>
Messiah still and all alone<br>


O praise the name of the Lord our God<br>
O praise His name forever more<br>
For endless days we will sing Your praise<br>
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God<br>


And then on the third at break of dawn<br>
The Son of heaven rose again<br>
O trampled death where is your sting<br>
The angels roar for Christ the King<br>

O praise the name of the Lord our God<br>
O praise His name forever more<br>
For endless days we will sing Your praise<br>
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God<br>


He shall return in robes of white<br>
The blazing Son shall pierce the night<br>
And I will rise among the saints<br>
My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face<br>
O praise the name of the Lord our God<br>
O praise His name forever more<br>
For endless days we will sing Your praise<br>
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God<br>
O praise the name of the Lord our God<br>
O praise His name forever more<br>
For endless days we will sing Your praise<br>
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God<br>

Oh Lord, oh Lord our God<br>

### 3. I have seen my Father’s glory <br>
Revealed in Jesus Christ<br>
And the more that I behold Him<br>
The more He satisfies<br>


When I gaze upon His beauty<br>
When I see Him as I should<br>
Then my eyes are lifted upward<br>
For His glory and my good<br>




There is hope in every trial<br>
For I can trust the Lord<br>
He will turn my heart towards Him<br>
And help me bear the thorn<br>


So in faith I follow Jesus<br>
On the road not understood<br>
For I know that He is working<br>
For His glory and my good<br>




To our God be the glory<br>
To our God be praise<br>
He alone, the name above all names<br>
I will boast ever only in the Lord my God<br>
For I know<br>
His glory is my good<br>




See the open arms of Jesus<br>
Upon the cross that day<br>
What they understood as weakness<br>
Deserves my every praise<br>


For the charge that was against me<br>
It was nailed into the wood<br>
Yes I know that He has saved me<br>
For His glory and my good<br>


To our God be the glory<br>
To our God be praise<br>
He alone, the name above all names<br>
I will boast ever only in the Lord my God<br>
For I know<br>
His glory is my good<br>




Would I gladly be made nothing<br>
That Christ would be made more<br>
Would I seek the only kingdom<br>
That far outweighs them all<br>


I will stand before my Father<br>
Where the faithful saints have stood<br>
And with joy my heart shall praise Him<br>
For His glory and my good<br>


To our God be the glory<br>
To our God be praise<br>
He alone, the name above all names<br>
I will boast ever only in the Lord my God<br>
For I know<br>
His glory is my good<br>


To our God be the glory<br>
To our God be praise<br>
He alone, the name above all names<br>
I will boast ever only in the Lord my God<br>
For I know<br>
His glory is my good<br>


Yes I know<br>
His glory is my good<br>


### 4. Trust & Obey<br>
When we walk with the Lord<br>
In the light of His Word<br>
What a glory He sheds on our way<br>
While we do His good will<br>
He abides with us still<br>
And with all who will trust and obey<br>


There's no other way<br>
To be happy in Jesus<br>
With peace in my mind, joy in my heart<br>
I'll take up my cross<br>
For all of my days<br>
I'll do what You say<br>
There's no other way<br>
But to trust and obey<br>


Then in fellowship sweet<br>
We will sit at His feet<br>
Or we'll walk by His side in the way<br>
What He says we will do<br>
Where He sends we will go<br>
Never fear, only trust and obey<br>


There's no other way<br>
To be happy in Jesus<br>
With peace in my mind, and joy in my heart<br>
I'll take up my cross<br>
For all of my days<br>
I'll do what You say<br>
There's no other way<br>
But to trust and obey<br>


I'll trust the Lord<br>
I'll trust the Lord<br>
You will be faithful<br>
Like You've been before<br>
Oh, I'll trust You, Lord<br>
Yes, I'll trust You, Lord<br>
Oh, for the grace<br>
To trust You with more<br>


I'll trust the Lord<br>
I'll trust the Lord<br>
You will be faithful <br>
Like You've been before<br>
I'll trust the Lord<br>
Yes, I'll trust the Lord<br>
Oh, for the grace <br>
To trust You with more<br>


There's no other way<br>
To be happy in Jesus<br>
With peace in my mind, and joy in my heart<br>
I'll take up my cross<br>
For all of my days<br>
I'll do what You say<br>
There's no other way<br>
But to trust and obey<br>


I'll do what You say<br>
There's no other way<br>
But to trust and obey<br>


Trust and obey<br>
For there's no other way<br>
To be happy in Jesus<br>
But to trust and obey<br>
