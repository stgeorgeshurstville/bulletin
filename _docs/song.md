### 9:30am Song Lyrics<br>

### 1. Come Thou Long Expected Jesus<br>
Come, thou long expected Jesus,<br>
born to set thy people free;<br>
from our fears and sins release us,<br>
let us find our rest in thee.<br>
Israel's strength and consolation,<br>
hope of all the earth thou art;<br>
dear desire of every nation,<br>
joy of every longing heart.<br><br>
 
Born thy people to deliver,<br>
born a child and yet a King,<br>
born to reign in us forever,<br>
now thy gracious kingdom bring.<br>
By thine own eternal spirit<br>
rule in all our hearts alone;<br>
by thine all sufficient merit,<br>
raise us to thy glorious throne.<br><br>
 
Joy to those who long to see thee<br>
Dayspring from on high appear<br>
Come, thou promised Rod of Jesse<br>
Of thy birth we long to hear<br>
O’er the hills the angels singing<br>
News glad tidings of a birth<br>
Go to Him your praises bringing<br>
Christ the Lord has come to earth<br><br>

### 2. Jerusalem<br>
See Him in Jerusalem<br>
Walking where the crowds are<br>
Once these streets had sung to Him<br>
Now they cry for murder<br><br>

Such a frail and lonely Man<br>
Holding up the heavy cross<br>
See Him walking in Jerusalem<br>
On the road to save us<br>
See Him there upon the hill<br>
Hear the scorn and laughter<br>
Silent as a lamb He waits<br>
Praying to the Father<br><br>

See the King who made the sun<br>
And the moon and shining stars<br>
Let the soldiers hold and nail Him down<br>
So that He could save them<br><br>

See Him there upon the cross<br>
Now no longer breathing<br>
Dust that formed the watching crowds<br>
Takes the blood of Jesus<br><br>

Feel the earth is shaking now<br>
See the veil is split in two<br>
And He stood before the wrath of God<br>
Shielding sinners with His blood<br><br>

See the empty tomb today<br>
Death could not contain Him<br>
Once the Servant of the world<br>
Now in victory reigning<br><br>

Lift your voices to the One<br>
Who is seated on the throne<br>
See Him in the New Jerusalem<br>
Praise the One who saved us<br><br>

Lift your voices to the One<br>
Who is seated on the throne<br>
See Him in the New Jerusalem<br>
Praise the One who saved us<br>
Praise the One who saved us<br><br>

### 3. Man of Sorrow<br>
Man of sorrows, Lamb of God<br>
By His own betrayed<br>
The sin of man and wrath of God<br>
Has been on Jesus laid<br><br>

Silent as He stood accused<br>
Beaten, mocked, and scorned<br>
Bowing to the Father's will<br>
He took a crown of thorns<br><br>

Oh, that rugged cross my salvation<br>
Where Your love poured out over me<br>
And now my soul cries out hallelujah<br>
Praise and honour unto Thee<br><br>

Sent of heaven God's own Son<br>
To purchase and redeem<br>
And reconcile the very ones<br>
Who nailed Him to that tree<br><br>

Oh, that rugged cross my salvation<br>
Where Your love poured out over me<br>
Now my soul cries out hallelujah<br>
Praise and honour unto Thee<br><br>

Now my debt is paid<br>
It is paid in full<br>
By the precious blood<br>
That my Jesus spilled<br><br>

Now the curse of sin<br>
Has no hold on me<br>
Whom the Son sets free<br>
Oh, is free indeed<br><br>

Now my debt is paid<br>
It is paid in full<br>
By the precious blood<br>
That my Jesus spilled<br><br>

Now the curse of sin<br>
Has no hold on me<br>
Whom the Son sets free<br>
Oh, is free indeed<br><br>

Oh, that rugged cross my salvation<br>
Where Your love poured out over me<br>
Now my soul cries out hallelujah<br>
Praise and honour unto Thee<br><br>

See the stone is rolled away<br>
Behold the empty tomb<br>
Hallelujah, God be praised<br>
He's risen from the grave<br><br>

Oh, that rugged cross my salvation<br>
Where Your love poured out over me<br>
Now my soul cries out hallelujah<br>
Praise and honour unto Thee<br><br>

Oh, that rugged cross my salvation<br>
Where Your love poured out over me<br>
Now my soul cries out hallelujah<br>
Praise and honour unto Thee<br>
Praise and honour unto Thee<br><br>

### 4. Arise, Shine (Darkness like a Shroud)<br>
Darkness like a shroud covers the earth;<br>
Evil like a cloud covers the people.<br>
But the Lord will rise upon you,<br>
And His glory will appear on you-<br>
Nations will come to your light.<br><br>

Arise, shine, your light has come,<br>
The glory of the Lord has risen on you!<br>
Arise, shine, your light has come,<br>
Jesus the Light of the world has come.<br><br>

Children of the light, be clean and pure.<br>
Rise, you sleepers, Christ will shine on you.<br>
Take the Spirit’s flashing two-edged sword<br>
And with faith declare God’s mighty word;<br>
Stand up and in His strength be strong.<br><br>

Arise, shine, your light has come,<br>
The glory of the Lord has risen on you!<br>
Arise, shine, your light has come,<br>
Jesus the Light of the world has come.<br><br>

Here among us now, Christ the light<br>
Kindles brighter flames in our trembling hearts.<br>
Living Word, our l, come guide our feet<br>
As we walk as one in light and peace,<br>
Till justice and truth shine like the sun.<br><br>

Arise, shine, your light has come,<br>
The glory of the Lord has risen on you!<br>
Arise, shine, your light has come,<br>
Jesus the Light of the world has come.<br><br>

Like a city bright so let us blaze;<br>
Lights in every street turning night to day.<br>
And the darkness shall not overcome<br>
Till the fulness of Christ’s kingdom comes,<br>
Dawning to God’s eternal day.<br><br>

Arise, shine, your light has come,<br>
The glory of the Lord has risen on you!<br>
Arise, shine, your light has come,<br>
Jesus the Light of the world<br>
Jesus the Light of the world<br>
Jesus the Light of the world has come.<br><br>
