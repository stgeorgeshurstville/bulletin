## 9:30am Song Lyrics<br>

### 1. How Great is our God<br>
The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty<br>
Let all the earth rejoice<br>
All the earth rejoice<br>

He wraps himself in Light<br>
And darkness tries to hide<br>
And trembles at His voice<br>
Trembles at His voice<br>


How great is our God, sing with me<br>
How great is our God, and all will see<br>
How great, how great is our God<br>

Age to age He stands<br>
And time is in His hands<br>
Beginning and the end<br>
Beginning and the end<br>

The Godhead Three in One<br>
Father Spirit Son<br>
The Lion and the Lamb<br>
The Lion and the Lamb<br>

How great is our God, sing with me<br>
How great is our God, and all will see<br>
How great, how great is our God<br>


Name above all names<br>
Worthy of our praise<br>
My heart will sing<br>
How great is our God<br>

Name above all names<br>
Worthy of our praise<br>
My heart will sing<br>
How great is our God<br>


How great is our God, sing with me<br>
How great is our God, and all will see<br>
How great, how great is our God<br>


### 2. O Praise the Name<br>
I cast my mind to Calvary<br>
Where Jesus bled and died for me<br>
I see His wounds, His hands, His feet<br>
My Saviour on that cursed tree<br>

His body bound and drenched in tears<br>
They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb<br>
The entrance sealed by heavy stone<br>
Messiah still and all alone<br>


O praise the name of the Lord our God<br>
O praise His name forever more<br>
For endless days we will sing Your praise<br>
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God<br>


And then on the third at break of dawn<br>
The Son of heaven rose again<br>
O trampled death where is your sting<br>
The angels roar for Christ the King<br>

O praise the name of the Lord our God<br>
O praise His name forever more<br>
For endless days we will sing Your praise<br>
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God<br>


He shall return in robes of white<br>
The blazing Son shall pierce the night<br>
And I will rise among the saints<br>
My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face<br>
O praise the name of the Lord our God<br>
O praise His name forever more<br>
For endless days we will sing Your praise<br>
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God<br>
O praise the name of the Lord our God<br>
O praise His name forever more<br>
For endless days we will sing Your praise<br>
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God<br>

Oh Lord, oh Lord our God<br>

### 3. I have seen my Father’s glory <br>
Revealed in Jesus Christ
And the more that I behold Him
The more He satisfies


When I gaze upon His beauty
When I see Him as I should
Then my eyes are lifted upward
For His glory and my good




There is hope in every trial
For I can trust the Lord
He will turn my heart towards Him
And help me bear the thorn


So in faith I follow Jesus
On the road not understood
For I know that He is working
For His glory and my good




To our God be the glory
To our God be praise
He alone, the name above all names
I will boast ever only in the Lord my God
For I know
His glory is my good




See the open arms of Jesus
Upon the cross that day
What they understood as weakness
Deserves my every praise


For the charge that was against me
It was nailed into the wood
Yes I know that He has saved me
For His glory and my good


To our God be the glory
To our God be praise
He alone, the name above all names
I will boast ever only in the Lord my God
For I know
His glory is my good




Would I gladly be made nothing
That Christ would be made more
Would I seek the only kingdom
That far outweighs them all


I will stand before my Father
Where the faithful saints have stood
And with joy my heart shall praise Him
For His glory and my good


To our God be the glory
To our God be praise
He alone, the name above all names
I will boast ever only in the Lord my God
For I know
His glory is my good


To our God be the glory
To our God be praise
He alone, the name above all names
I will boast ever only in the Lord my God
For I know
His glory is my good


Yes I know
His glory is my good


### 4. Trust & Obey<br>
When we walk with the Lord
In the light of His Word
What a glory He sheds on our way
While we do His good will
He abides with us still
And with all who will trust and obey


There's no other way
To be happy in Jesus
With peace in my mind, joy in my heart
I'll take up my cross
For all of my days
I'll do what You say
There's no other way
But to trust and obey


Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet
Or we'll walk by His side in the way
What He says we will do
Where He sends we will go
Never fear, only trust and obey


There's no other way
To be happy in Jesus
With peace in my mind, and joy in my heart
I'll take up my cross
For all of my days
I'll do what You say
There's no other way
But to trust and obey


I'll trust the Lord
I'll trust the Lord
You will be faithful
Like You've been before
Oh, I'll trust You, Lord
Yes, I'll trust You, Lord
Oh, for the grace
To trust You with more


I'll trust the Lord
I'll trust the Lord
You will be faithful 
Like You've been before
I'll trust the Lord
Yes, I'll trust the Lord
Oh, for the grace 
To trust You with more


There's no other way
To be happy in Jesus
With peace in my mind, and joy in my heart
I'll take up my cross
For all of my days
I'll do what You say
There's no other way
But to trust and obey


I'll do what You say
There's no other way
But to trust and obey


Trust and obey
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus
But to trust and obey
