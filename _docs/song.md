### 9:30am Song Lyrics<br><br>

### 1. Hallelujah to The King of Kings
Hallelujah To The Kings of Kings<br>
Maker of the heavens and earth<br>
Exalted by the roar of a multitude<br>
“Salvation and glory and power<br>
belong to our God”.<br>

The cry of hallelujah resounds<br>
The fullness of time shows his victory<br>
Justice and truth are revealed<br>
his wisdom adored<br>

Hallelujah to the King of Kings!<br>
Hallelujah the Almighty reigns!<br>
Let us all rejoice and give him all our praise, our praise.<br>
Hallelujah to the Lord of Lords!<br>
Hallelujah to the God of power!<br>
The people of the Lord are ready to see their king,<br>
Jesus! Jesus!<br>

Praise the Lord you Servants of God<br>
All who fear him come, whether small or great.<br>
Fall before his throne in awe<br>
And worship him<br>

Blessed are those who will feast<br>
The glorious banquet of God himself<br>
The wedding of the Lamb has come,<br>
His bride is now here.<br>

Hallelujah to the King of Kings!<br>
Hallelujah the Almighty reigns!<br>
Let us all rejoice and give him all our praise, our praise.<br>
Hallelujah to the Lord of Lords!<br>
Hallelujah to the God of power!<br>
The people of the Lord are ready to see their king,<br>
Jesus! Jesus!<br>
Jesus! Jesus!<br>

### 2. Come Thou Long Expected Jesus<br>
Come, thou long expected Jesus,<br>
Born to set thy people free;<br>
From our fears and sins release us,<br>
Let us find our rest in thee.<br>
Israel's strength and consolation,<br>
Hope of all the earth thou art;<br>
Dear desire of every nation,<br>
Joy of every longing heart.<br>
Born thy people to deliver,<br>
Born a child and yet a King,<br>
Born to reign in us forever,<br>
Now thy gracious kingdom bring.<br>
By thine own eternal spirit<br>
Rule in all our hearts alone;<br>
By thine all sufficient merit,<br>
Raise us to thy glorious throne.<br>

Joy to those who long to see thee<br>
Dayspring from on high appear<br>
Come, thou promised Rod of Jesse<br>
Of thy birth we long to hear<br>
O’er the hills the angels singing<br>
News glad tidings of a birth<br>
Go to Him your praises bringing<br>
Christ the Lord has come to earth<br>

### 3. O Come O Come Emmanuel<br>
O come, O come, Emmanuel<br>
And ransom captive Israel<br>
That mourns in lonely exile here<br>
Until the Son of God appear<br>

O come, Thou, Dayspring from on high<br>
And cause Thy light on us to rise<br>
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night<br>
And death’s dark shadow put to flight<br>

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel<br>
Shall come to thee, O Israel<br>

O come, O come, true prophet of the Lord<br>
And turn the key to heaven’s door<br>
Be Thou our comforter and guide<br>
And lead us to the Father’s side<br>

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel<br>
Shall by His word our darkness dispel<br>

O come, our great High Priest, and intercede<br>
Thy sacrifice, our only plea<br>
The judgment we no longer fear<br>
Thy precious blood has brought us near<br>

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel<br>
Has banished every fear of hell<br>

O Come, Thou King of nations bring<br>
An end to all our suffering<br>
Bid every pain and sorrow cease<br>
And reign now as our Prince of Peace<br>

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel<br>
Shall come again with us to dwell<br>
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel<br>
Shall come again with us to dwell<br>

### 4. Never Once <br><br>
<br>Standing on this mountaintop
<br>Looking just how far we've come
<br>Knowing that for every step
<br>You were with us
<br><br>Kneeling on this battle ground
<br>Seeing just how much You've done
<br>Knowing every victory
<br>Was Your power in us
<br><br>Scars and struggles on the way
<br>But with joy our hearts can say
<br>Yes, our hearts can say
<br><br>Never once did we ever walk alone
<br>Never once did You leave us on our own
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br><br>Kneeling on this battle ground
<br>Seeing just how much You've done
<br>Knowing every victory
<br>Was Your power in us
<br><br>Scars and struggles on the way
<br>But with joy our hearts can say
<br>Yes, our hearts can say
<br><br>Never once did we ever walk alone
<br>Never once did You leave us on our own
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br><br>Scars and struggles on the way
<br>But with joy our hearts can say
<br>Never once did we ever walk alone
<br>Carried by Your constant grace
<br>Held within Your perfect peace
<br>Never once, no, we never walk alone
<br><br>Never once did we ever walk alone
<br>Never once did You leave us on our own
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br>Every step we are breathing in Your grace
<br>Evermore we'll be breathing out Your praise
<br><br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br>You are faithful, God, You are faithful
<br>Your are, You are faithful, God, You are faithful
