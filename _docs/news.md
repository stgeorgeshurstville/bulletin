**Post-AGM forum:** Thank you for those who took the time to come and give us your thoughts. We will be following these up with more meetings. A decision needs to be made around the end of May. 

**All Gen:**
During the school holidays, we have a wonderful opportunity to come together as one assembly (regardless of age or stage) and learn the truth of the Gospel. Specifically, we'll be tracing the story of Jesus's life during his final days, from his arrival in Jerusalem on Palm Sunday to his crucifixion on Good Friday, his resurrection on Easter Sunday and his ascension back into heaven. These all-age services will be fun, interactive, and greatly edifying for everyone. The dates are listed below:

- 20th of April (Easter Sunday) 

- 27th of April 

**Easter 2025- From Darkness to Dawn:**
Do you feel the weight of the world's darkness? Political storms, echoes of conflict, and an uncertain environment marked by floods, cyclones, and wildfires. Yet, at Easter, we are reminded that even the deepest night cannot extinguish the hope of a new dawn. Come to our Easter services and discover this new dawn, a promise of hope that comes through Jesus' death and resurrection.

- Easter Sunday, April 20th:
9:30 AM at 124 Forest Road
4:00 PM at 2 The Avenue

"A new day will dawn on us from above because our God is loving and merciful. He will give light to those who live in the dark and in death’s shadow. He will guide us into the way of peace." Luke 1:78-79
