Please bring  your children into the Church Hall and pick them up from the Church hall (9:30, 11am) or the ministry centre (4pm). Please speak with Carol, Brian or June to find out more. 
- **Sunday Dinners:** We won’t have the option to order take away boxes in January due to the team being away. You can still keep using the Hall and bring your own dinner or get food elsewhere as we continue to meet and spur each other on.
