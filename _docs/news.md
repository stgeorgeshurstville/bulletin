## General

- **Collection from Market**: Despite the hot weather last weekend over the course of our Christmas Markets, we are grateful for the participation of every volunteer and the generosity of all stalls that had decided to donate all their proceeds towards Anglicare and Hurstville Public School. We were able to surpass last year and had raised a total of $4,419.80
- **Anglicare (Christmas Day Collection)t**: Our collection on Christmas Day will go towards Anglicare which aims to see Jesus Christ honoured, lives enriched and communities strengthened. This is the same organisation we gave to and partnered with during our Christmas markets. 
- **Summer Holidays: All Gen Services will be on: 24 Dec, 31 Dec, 7 Jan and 28 Jan** We will be running a simple summer holiday program for children from Preschool to Year 6 (2023 school grade) during 14 and 21 January 2024. We are asking church adults to give one Sunday at either 9:30am, 11am or 4pm to come hang out and play with the kids. Please speak with Carol, Brian or June to find out more. 

- **Growing in Our Welcoming**
