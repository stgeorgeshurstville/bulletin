## General
- **Vision 2025:** Our vision for 2025 is the ‘shine for Jesus, everywhere, anytime.’ 
We would love for you to take a few minutes to complete the Shine survey to help give us a picture of where we are as a church.  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezXaAZ_-lCp9NhPs6MlBz5c127LD8oH5YMn1BdLzrOT2Q8Ug/viewform?usp=dialog

- **Post- AGM forums:** 12 April (Cantonese) at 430pm; 13 April 130pm in the church. For members to ask any questions and raise any matter they wish to raise.
  
- **The 2025 Autumn Life Quarterly** God has been growing our church, and our 4PM English service is now so full that visitors are leaving because they can't find a seat. With Easter coming, this challenge will only get bigger.
  
- **Our 4PM English Service is Overflowing – We Need to Act!** God has been growing our church, and our 4PM English service is now so full that visitors are leaving because they can't find a seat. With Easter coming, this challenge will only get bigger. To make space for more people to hear the gospel, we’re making a change: **From 6 April 2025, our English and Mandarin congregations will swap meeting spaces.** We’ll also be working hard to ensure the Hall is well-prepared for our Mandarin brothers and sisters. This is an exciting opportunity to welcome more people and keep sharing Jesus with our community—let’s embrace it together!

- **All Gen!**
During the school holidays, we have a wonderful opportunity to come together as one assembly (regardless of age or stage) and learn the truth of the Gospel. Specifically, we'll be tracing the story of Jesus's life during his final days, from his arrival in Jerusalem on Palm Sunday to his crucifixion on Good Friday, his resurrection on Easter Sunday and his ascension back into heaven. These all-age services will be fun, interactive, and greatly edifying for everyone. The dates are listed below:

-13th of April
  
-18th of April (Good Friday) 

-20th of April (Easter Sunday) 

-27th of April 

- **Easter 2025: From Darkness to Dawn!**
Do you feel the weight of the world's darkness? Political storms, echoes of conflict, and an uncertain environment marked by floods, cyclones, and wildfires. Yet, at Easter, we are reminded that even the deepest night cannot extinguish the hope of a new dawn. Come to our Easter services and discover this new dawn, a promise of hope that comes through Jesus' death and resurrection.

-Good Friday, April 18th:
11:00 AM at 2 The Avenue

-Easter Sunday, April 20th:
9:30 AM at 124 Forest Road
4:00 PM at 2 The Avenue
"A new day will dawn on us from above because our God is loving and merciful. He will give light to those who live in the dark and in death’s shadow. He will guide us into the way of peace." Luke 1:78-79
