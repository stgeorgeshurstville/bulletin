## General
- **Mid Autumn Festival Celebration:** Our Mandarin congregations will organise a Mid Autumn Festival Celebration on 30 September (Saturday) at 5pm in the chapel. The aim is to use this event to invite our Mandarin speaking non-Christian friends and family to come and hear the good news of Jesus. Hardcopy and electronic versions of the invitations are now available.

- **Berkeley Trip:** We’ll be visiting again on Sat the 23rd of Sep. Please let Rev. Lam know if you would like to come and give out food to people in need, help with the Op Shop and chat with people, mow lawns for people who aren’t able to and see what ministry is like. This is a message from them about their and our recent visits: “Recently Wayne preached at around 10 services (3 with a translator) at the very large St. George’s Hurstville. A few days later a small group of BLC supporters from Hurstville travelled down to Berkeley with literally boots full of groceries with some of the largest bags of rice you have ever seen. They also spent a couple of hours doing Adopt A Block and then headed home. We say thank you to them and to everyone at Hurstville.”

- **Mission Partner:** We’ll be hearing from Mel Wang (our new mission partner from AAC) next Sunday.
  
- **NewGen ministries** term 3 finishes on 17 September. Everyone, young and old, are welcomed to join us at the **All-Gen Services** on 24 September, 1 October and 8 October in the 9:30 English, 11am Mandarin and 4pm English services. Term 4 will resume on the 15 October.

- **LIFE:** Want to know more about living life to the full? Come to our 5 week session starting on Sunday 17th Sep (11am @ 124 Forest Road and 5:30pm @ Seminar Room).  

- **Baptism:** Baptism is an outward sign of an inward reality and God’s grace towards his people who’ve come to trust in Jesus. Please speak to Rev. Alan if you are interested to be baptised. The dates are 22nd Oct (baptism) and 12th Nov (baptism and confirmation). 

- **Seminar:** The prevalence of ponorgraphy is as broad as the COVID pandemic and it’s just as harmful if not greater. We have invited the Rev. Dr Marshall Ballantine-Jones to help us.

  - for Parents on Fri 15th Sep 6:30-8pm in the Seminar Room: 8 things every parent needs to know about pornography and social media. 
  - for Everyone on Sun 17th Sep 2-3:30pm in the Chapel.
