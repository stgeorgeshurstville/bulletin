- **Post-AGM forum:** Thank you for those who took the time to come and give us your thoughts. We will be following these up with more meetings. A decision needs to be made around the end of May. 

- **All Gen:**
During the school holidays, we have a wonderful opportunity to come together as one assembly (regardless of age or stage) and learn the truth of the Gospel. Specifically, we'll be tracing the story of Jesus's life during his final days, from his arrival in Jerusalem on Palm Sunday to his crucifixion on Good Friday, his resurrection on Easter Sunday and his ascension back into heaven. These all-age services will be fun, interactive, and greatly edifying for everyone. The dates are listed below:

- 20th of April (Easter Sunday) 

- 27th of April

**Over the next three weeks, get ready to explore the very heart of what we believe as we trace how our God came to earth to rescue us and unite us to himself.**
This week, and every week, is a great opportunity to invite friends and family to hear why this is good news for them. To get a taste of what's to come, why not read John 1:1-14?

- The Very Person of God - 4th of May (John 1:1-14)
- The Story of the First and Last Adam - 11th of May (Romans 5:12-19)
- Being United with Christ - 18th of May (Ephesians 2:1-10)

- [**What are you doing for God’s glory in 2025?**](https://forms.gle/dshYacLA1kB8xpkn7)
