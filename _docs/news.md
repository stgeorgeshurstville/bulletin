## General
- **Church Office Returns to the Rectory**: After a year-long trial period, we've determined that the Rectory's Vestry is not the ideal location for our church office. Effective immediately, the office has returned to its original location at the Rectory. We extend our heartfelt thanks to:
  - Pastor Bijaya and family for their generous hospitality
  - Jen Tung and her team of volunteers for their hard work during the transition

  For security and confidentiality reasons, please note the office is now accessible only to staff members. We appreciate your understanding as we make this adjustment to better serve our church family.

_ **Ministry Support Centre Renovation Complete:** Exciting updates at our Ministry Support Centre! The space has been transformed with:

  ✔ Removal of dividing walls
  ✔ Installation of new folding doors
  ✔ Enhanced flexibility for various ministries
  
  
  This project was made possible through your faithful giving. If you'd like to help cover the remaining costs, donations can be made to:
    Projects Account
    BSB: 032-055
    Account #: 253052
  
  We thank God for providing the resources and skilled workers to complete this improvement to our shared ministry space.


**Over the next three weeks, get ready to explore the very heart of what we believe as we trace how our God came to earth to rescue us and unite us to himself.**
This week, and every week, is a great opportunity to invite friends and family to hear why this is good news for them. To get a taste of what's to come, why not read John 1:1-14?

- The Very Person of God - 4th of May (John 1:1-14)
- The Story of the First and Last Adam - 11th of May (Romans 5:12-19)
- Being United with Christ - 18th of May (Ephesians 2:1-10)
