## General
**Music night annoucement - TBA!**

**Berkeley Life Centre asking for Summer Clothing!** 
Now that the seasons are changing, our mission partners at Berkeley Life Centre are restocking their Op Shop for the summer. They're looking for donations of summer clothing, bed linen, and baby and children's wear to help those in our community.

If you have something you'd like to donate some clothing there is a dedicated space on a set of shelves behind the stage in the hall. It’s labelled with a sign so you won’t be able to miss it. 

**Online Prayer Meeting**
As we look at a world in desperate need of the Gospel, we can feel hopeless to change it. Which is why God calls us to gather together in prayer, believing he will work through us.

Join us as we unite to pray for our community and for the world to hear the good news of Jesus Christ specifically as we think about how we can try and connect with the community at Hurstville Public School. 

Date: 17th of September
Time: 8:00 -8:30pm

**Robotics Day is Coming!**
On the 13th of October we’d love for you to save the date as we are planning a Robotics Day specifically for primary school children. This day coincides with a pupil free among public primary schools. 
If you are able to help with the running of the day in whatever form we'd love to hear from you.
If you are interested in volunteering, please contact Ben for more information.



**Vision 2025:**
Our vision for 2025 is the ‘shine for Jesus, everywhere, anytime.’ We would love for you to take a few minutes to complete the Shine survey to help give us a picture of where we are as a church [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezXaAZ_-lCp9NhPs6MlBz5c127LD8oH5YMn1BdLzrOT2Q8Ug/viewform?usp=dialog).
