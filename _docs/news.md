- **New safe ministry rep**: At St George's, we are deeply committed to providing a safe environment for all our members and guests. Safe ministry practices are not just a compliance requirement—they reflect our core belief that our God cares for the vulnerable.
The role of Safe Ministry Representative plays a vital part in ensuring this commitment. We want to thank Pastor Sunny Yu for faithfully serving in this role in the past. As of 11 December 2024, we are pleased to announce that Mrs. Daisy Wu (Cantonese 9:30 congregation) has taken over this responsibility.
Daisy is well-equipped for this role, being a trainer of the Safe Ministry Essentials course. We thank God for her willingness to serve and for her passion in ensuring our church remains a safe place for everyone.
Let’s continue to pray for Daisy in her new role and give thanks for Sunny’s dedicated service.
