## General
**Park & Ride:**
Dear Church Family, to better serve our families, elderly, and those with mobility needs, we’re introducing a ‘Drop and Ride’ system from the first Sunday of July. Here’s how it will work:

- Temporary Parking Zone:
A clearly marked area (equivalent to 3 car spaces) will be reserved for short stops (max 5 minutes).
This will be available both at church and Hurstville Public School (HPS).

- How to Use It:
Drivers: Enter the area, make a U-turn, and park facing South (Forest Rd) for easier exit.
- Who It’s For:
Parents/Carers dropping off children for the NewGen program.
Carers assisting elderly members or others with mobility challenges.
- A Call to Love:
We urge everyone to respect this space and love others practically —so those who need it most can access it safely and efficiently.

For questions, please contact Brian Tung.

**Celebrating 30 Years of Cross-Cultural Ministry!**

Join us on Sunday, August 3rd, as we celebrate a significant milestone: 30 years of cross-cultural ministry at our church! 

Three decades ago, our parish council made a pivotal decision to reach out to the many Chinese immigrants settling in our area. What began as a heartfelt desire to proclaim the gospel has blossomed into a vibrant, multicultural community. Today, God has blessed us with two Cantonese, two Mandarin, and a Nepali service, reflecting the beautiful diversity He has brought into our midst. 

This special day will be a wonderful opportunity to celebrate our rich past and dream together about the future as we consider how to continue reaching our local communities with the transformative message of the gospel.

Event Details:
When: Sunday, August 3rd, starting at 10:00 AM
Where: Hurstville Public School
Following our service, we'll share in a celebratory lunch at 12:00 PM at St. George's Hurstville Anglican Church. Please note that there will be a cost for lunch.
