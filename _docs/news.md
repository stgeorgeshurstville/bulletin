**An Epic Journey: Studying Isaiah**

This term, our church has started a journey of studying the Book of Isaiah, leading us all the way up to Christmas. It promises to be an epic spiritual journey as we trace the prophet’s message to his people and explore how that powerful message relates to us as God's people on this side of the cross.

To get the most out of our study of Isaiah, we encourage everyone to be reading it for themselves. As Christians, we know that hearing God's voice through His Word is essential to worshipping Him as Lord, but this vital task often gets squeezed out of our busy schedules.

So, to make the most of this epic journey, we encourage you to read all 66 chapters of Isaiah over the next 9 weeks. To help you on this journey, we’ve created a [9-week reading plan](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG16YkibTQ/h1WDqF08taLnE5OVQGcaVA/view?utm_content=DAG16YkibTQ&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h659a985df1) so that you can see the majesty of what God has done for his people.

**Missionary Guest Speaker: JC**

We have the wonderful privilege of welcoming JC (aka Mr Noodle) to our 9:30pm and 4:00pm services on Sunday, November 2nd, as he shares about his overseas ministry.

As a church, it is so encouraging for us to hear JC's story as It can shape how we should live by making costly decisions for the sake of Jesus. His story also gives us a window into how we can best support someone like JC as he endeavors to spread the Gospel to the ends of the earth. Please make plans not to miss this great opportunity!

**Warden's News**

We’re planning to start prep work on the inner lawn of the main church site this Monday 27/10 from 10am to get ready for laying artificial turf. We need 4 helpers for digging, levelling, and laying the artificial turf. If you can lend a hand, please let Darren know!
