## General
- **Re: 124 Forest Rd:**
    - Dear Church Family, We want to share some important news regarding 124 Forest Rd. At the end of June 2025, we will no longer have access to the premises, as the building is set to be demolished. This space was a blessing, provided by the Lord through the generosity of our members when we needed more room for Sunday services. While this is disappointing, it is not unexpected, and we trust that God will continue to lead us forward. As we seek alternative premises, we invite you to pray for wisdom in making the right decisions‚Äîconsidering location, cost, and the future needs of our church. To discuss and pray about the future direction of our church‚Äîincluding property, resources, and redevelopment‚Äîwe encourage you to join us for a Church Prayer & Vision Meeting on:
    - üìÖ Sunday, 2 March 2025
    - üïë 2:00 PM
    - üìç At the Church

- **NewGen Children‚Äôs Ministry has resumed for 2025:** We have a 0-5yo cr√®che/ toddlers program, and a K-6 program at 9:30am, 11am and 4pm. Please leave enough time before service for start of year registrations. If you have any questions please contact Pastor Carol Chiu. 

- **Youth Group** has started: Reminder that it is every Friday from 7pm to 9pm. Find our more details [here](https://stgeorgeshurstville.org.au/youth-group)
