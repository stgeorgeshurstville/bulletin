From 8th to 15th December, we’re excited to welcome a team of university students who will be joining us again to serve. If you’re able to host and provide accommodation for these students, please get in touch with your congregation pastors. Let’s work together to make this a week of impactful outreach!
- **Christmas Market Day 14 Dec:** We invite everyone to join us on December 14th from 10 AM to 2 PM for our Christmas Market. This is a great opportunity to connect with the community, share the Gospel, and serve together to help those in need.

In addition, we encourage everyone to download the invitation card for this Christmas Market [here](https://stgeorgeshurstville.org.au/christmas) and invite friends and neighbours through social media and other channels.
