## General
**Park & Ride:**
Dear Church Family, to better serve our families, elderly, and those with mobility needs, we’re introducing a ‘Drop and Ride’ system from the first Sunday of July. Here’s how it will work:

- Temporary Parking Zone:
A clearly marked area (equivalent to 3 car spaces) will be reserved for short stops (max 5 minutes).
This will be available both at church and Hurstville Public School (HPS).
- How to Use It:
Drivers: Enter the area, make a U-turn, and park facing South (Forest Rd) for easier exit.
- Who It’s For:
Parents/Carers dropping off children for the NewGen program.
Carers assisting elderly members or others with mobility challenges.
- A Call to Love:
We urge everyone to respect this space and love others practically —so those who need it most can access it safely and efficiently.

For questions, please contact Brian Tung.


**Life quarterly:**

**Lost Property Box:**
We now have a Lost Property Box near the church inner lawn. If you’ve misplaced something recently, please check the box. Items will be kept for two weeks. After that, unclaimed belongings will be donated to Anglicare. Thank you for helping us keep our church clean and organised.


**Packing Down- Our Final Service at Forest Road:**
Our time at 124 Forest Road is coming to an end, with our final service at this location scheduled for Sunday, June 29th. After the service, we'd love for everyone who is able to stay behind and help us pack down the space. We anticipate this will only take about one hour of your time. To show our appreciation, $8 lunch will be available for all who'd like to stay for fellowship afterwards from 12pm. Let's work together to make this transition smooth and efficient!

*"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."* - Mark 10:45

For our next sermon series as a church we will be exploring "The Heart of Service," For 6-week we'll be delving into the profound meaning of serving God and one another. Just as our Lord Jesus exemplified in His own life and ministry, our drive to serve stems directly from His selfless service to us.

We will unpack the multifaceted ways we can live out this calling within our church and beyond (as detailed in the graphics). Join us as we discover how to cultivate a heart of service, reflecting the very heart of Christ, and experience the transformative power of living a life dedicated to serving God through serving others.
