## General

- **NEW 4pm NewGen Children Ministry:**
 Some practicalities to be aware of:
    - The Family Spot (segment to help the whole church family and give us language to speak about Jesus to kids) will take place in the 4pm English Service each week except for the 1st week of each month where it will take place in the 4pm Mandarin Service instead.
    - Parents will need to register and sign in their kids with one of the Kids Leaders when they arrive in service and sign out their kids from their group’s rooms.
    - Toddlers Time/Creche (0-4 years old) will take place in the Playgroup Room and 4pm NewGen (Preschool-Year 6) will take place in the Seminar Room.

- **AAC/SGH merger:**
    1. Please be intentionally welcoming: identify, introduce, include. 
    2. Some practical changes: 
        - There will be a combined 4pm service (Mandarin/English) to formally welcome AAC into SGH. All are welcomed to join.
        - 4pm English congregation will meet in the church Hall and the New Life Nepalese Church will meet at 124 Forest Rd.
        - The 4pm services will not be streamed, but the 930 English and 11am Mandarin services will be available on our website.
        - Dinner will be served each week in the Hall after the 4pm services. Costs: $5. The deadline for a Sun dinner order is **Saturday 12pm**. Please place your order by filling this [form](https://tinyurl.com/sundinners)

- **Parking**: Our brothers and sisters at 11am are forced to double-park because of lack of car parking spaces. To serve them, please park off-site unless you have issues with mobility.  

- **Growing in our welcoming:**
