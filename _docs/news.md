## General

- **NEW 4pm NewGen Children Ministry:**
 Some practicalities to be aware of:
    - The Family Spot (segment to help the whole church family and give us language to speak about Jesus to kids) will take place in the 4pm English Service each week except for the 1st week of each month where it will take place in the 4pm Mandarin Service instead.
    - Parents will need to register and sign in their kids with one of the Kids Leaders when they arrive in service and sign out their kids from their group’s rooms.
    - Toddlers Time/Creche (0-4 years old) will take place in the Playgroup Room and 4pm NewGen (Preschool-Year 6) will take place in the Seminar Room.

- **Archaeology Study**: Part of the car park will be blocked off from use this coming Tuesday and Thursday (and possibly Friday) for the archeology study.

- **Berkeley Life Centre:**
  - We’ll have a training seminar about how to reach people especially from lower socioeconomic backgrounds (20th Aug 1-2pm in the Seminar Room).
  - We’ll be visiting and partnering with Berkeley Life Centre on these Sat mornings (26 Aug, 23 Sep and 18 Nov). We'll be doing things like giving out food to the neighbourhood, helping out at the op shop, mowing people's lawns etc. A good opportunity to experience and see what they do as we share the gospel and serve the community.
  - As always, they'll appreciate any non-perishable food items which they can give to those who are finding it tough. You can bring these to the Rectory.
  - You can also find out more about how to partner with our mission partners [here](https://stgeorgeshurstville.org.au/mission-partners)

- **Building Fund:** Your gifts to the building has been making a HUGE difference so far: it has enabled us to use 124 Forest Rd and to bless others with this facility. The latest is that we were able to tile the church hall with rubber mats to help improve the sound. The next project we’ll be doing is to repair the church roof. As many of you know the church roof has been leaking for some time and is causing damage to the inside of the church. The costs to repair the roof is around $12,000. Work is due to commence this week.  If you would like to give towards this project or the building fund generally, you can do so to this account:
