## General
**Park & Ride:**
Dear Church Family, to better serve our families, elderly, and those with mobility needs, we’re introducing a ‘Drop and Ride’ system from the first Sunday of July. Here’s how it will work:

- Temporary Parking Zone:
A clearly marked area (equivalent to 3 car spaces) will be reserved for short stops (max 5 minutes).
This will be available both at church and Hurstville Public School (HPS).

- How to Use It:
Drivers: Enter the area, make a U-turn, and park facing South (Forest Rd) for easier exit.
- Who It’s For:
Parents/Carers dropping off children for the NewGen program.
Carers assisting elderly members or others with mobility challenges.
- A Call to Love:
We urge everyone to respect this space and love others practically —so those who need it most can access it safely and efficiently.

For questions, please contact Brian Tung.

**St George’s Nepali church:**
St George’s Nepali church met for the first time yesterday on Saturday 5 July 2025. Praying God for bringing birth to this ministry. Please continue to remember our brothers and sisters and pray for their work and the salvation of Nepali in Sydney.

**Lost Property Box:**
We now have a Lost Property Box near the church inner lawn. If you’ve misplaced something recently, please check the box. Items will be kept for two weeks. After that, unclaimed belongings will be donated to Anglicare. Thank you for helping us keep our church clean and organised.

**Vision 2025:** 
Our vision for 2025 is the ‘shine for Jesus, everywhere, anytime.’ We would love for you to take a few minutes to complete the Shine survey to help give us a picture of where we are as a church [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezXaAZ_-lCp9NhPs6MlBz5c127LD8oH5YMn1BdLzrOT2Q8Ug/viewform?usp=dialog).
