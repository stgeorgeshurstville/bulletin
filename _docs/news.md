## General

- **AAC/SGH merger:**
    1. Please be intentionally welcoming: identify, introduce, include. 
    2. Some practical changes: 
        - There will be a combined 4pm service (Mandarin/English) to formally welcome AAC into SGH. All are welcomed to join.
        - 4pm English congregation will meet in the church Hall and the New Life Nepalese Church will meet at 124 Forest Rd.
        - The 4pm services will not be streamed, but the 930 English and 11am Mandarin services will be available on our website.
        - Dinner will be served each week in the Hall after the 4pm services. Costs: $5. The deadline for a Sun dinner order is **Saturday 12pm**. Please place your order by filling this [form](https://tinyurl.com/sundinners)

- **Parking**: Our brothers and sisters at 11am are forced to double-park because of lack of car parking spaces. To serve them, please park off-site unless you have issues with mobility.  

- **Growing in our welcoming:**
