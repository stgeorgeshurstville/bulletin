## General
**Thanksgiving for 30 Years of Cross-Cultural Ministry!**

Give thanks for last Sunday’s combined service, August 3rd, as we celebrate a significant milestone: 30 years of cross-cultural ministry at our church!

Three decades ago, our parish council made a pivotal decision to reach out to the many Chinese immigrants settling in our area. What began as a heartfelt desire to proclaim the gospel has blossomed into a vibrant, multicultural community. Today, God has blessed us with two Cantonese, two Mandarin, and a Nepali service, reflecting the beautiful diversity He has brought into our midst.

Thank you to all our volunteers and staff in making this special day happen. It was a wonderful time where we gathered and celebrated our rich past and dream together about the future as we consider how to continue reaching our local communities with the transformative message of the gospel.
