## General
### 2026 Vision: To Know Him and Make Him Known
This year, our vision is to know God and to make Him known. For many of us, "knowing God" can often be equated to simply knowing facts about Him. However, when the Bible speaks about knowing God, it describes seeing Him correctly so that it elicits a response of delight and awe. The more we understand His character and His qualities, the more we begin to marvel at what He has done for us through His Son.
To help us in this pursuit, we have started a six-week series on the Nicene Creed. This historic statement of belief has served the church for centuries by clarifying exactly who God is, helping His people to savor Him rightly.
Over the coming weeks, we invite you to pray that you would savor God in all His fullness as we strive to know Him more deeply together.

### Growing Together: Discipleship Group update
A big thank you to everyone who submitted their availability for our upcoming discipleship groups! We are thrilled to see so many of you eager to grow in your discipleship. If you haven’t put your name down yet, you can still do so through [this link](https://forms.gle/orMNCVmsTnuLH7Xx5)
Our groups will officially start the week beginning February 8th. Group leaders will get back to you shortly with more details regarding times and locations.
Our primary goal in organizing these groups is to ensure a healthy balance of participants; we want to make sure every group is intimate enough for deep conversation and that no single group becomes overcrowded. With that in mind, if you didn’t get your first preference, please come and speak with Ben. He’s happy to chat with you to ensure everyone feels settled and supported.
