### Growing Together: Discipleship Groups 2026
As we settle into the new year, we want to share an exciting update regarding our Discipleship Groups.

While our groups are currently in recess for the month of January, we are preparing to relaunch in early February! These groups are the heartbeat of our community—dedicated spaces for our regular members to grow together, study God’s Word, and encourage one another as we learn to better follow the Lord Jesus.

To help us place everyone in a group that fits their schedule, please fill out our [online form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXE4obODIdYkJuVEjM_f72rIKvcdW4yjre-ssMmP_LH3G6pQ/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=116695261415859153895) This provides us with a "window" into your weekly availability so we can form groups effectively.

Please note that your first preference may not be possible. As the group gets assembled we are hoping that each group has a good mix of people. So please be gracious  if you don’t get your first preference.

### Staff Update: Brian on Leave
Please note that Brian will be away on leave from January 8th – 25th. We wish him a restful time off!
If you require any assistance or have urgent matters during this period, please don't hesitate to reach out to Ben or Sunny, who will be happy to help.
