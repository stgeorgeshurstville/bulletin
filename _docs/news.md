## General
- **Church Office Returns to the Rectory**: After a year-long trial period, we've determined that the Rectory's Vestry is not the ideal location for our church office. Effective immediately, the office has returned to its original location at the Rectory. We extend our heartfelt thanks to:
  - Pastor Bijaya and family for their generous hospitality
  - Jen Tung and her team of volunteers for their hard work during the transition

  For security and confidentiality reasons, please note the office is now accessible only to staff members. We appreciate your understanding as we make this adjustment to better serve our church family.

- **Ministry Support Centre Renovation Complete:** Exciting updates at our Ministry Support Centre! The space has been transformed with:

  ✔ Removal of dividing walls
  ✔ Installation of new folding doors
  ✔ Enhanced flexibility for various ministries

  This project was made possible through your faithful giving. If you'd like to help cover the remaining costs, donations can be made to:

  We thank God for providing the resources and skilled workers to complete this improvement to our shared ministry space.

- **Vision 2025:** Our vision for 2025 is the ‘shine for Jesus, everywhere, anytime.’ We would love for you to take a few minutes to complete the Shine survey to help give us a picture of where we are as a church [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezXaAZ_-lCp9NhPs6MlBz5c127LD8oH5YMn1BdLzrOT2Q8Ug/viewform?usp=dialog).
