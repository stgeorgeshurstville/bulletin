## General
**Kids Holiday Hub is FULL!**

We are thrilled to announce that our Kids Holiday Hub is at capacity!
Please join us in taking a moment to give thanks:
- Thank God for His generosity in providing all these wonderful children He has placed in our care for the day, many of whom have very little prior connection to our church.
- Thank our willing leaders who are taking time out of their schedules and work hours to serve our church and His Gospel.
- We ask that you also please pray that many seeds will be planted in the hearts of these children.

**Life Course**

Whether you are a genuine seeker or a skeptic, come to our Life Course where we will consider the life-changing message of the Gospel as it relates to the person of Jesus.
We are excited to announce our upcoming Life Course, a four-week journey designed to provide a welcoming space for honest conversations. The course begins on Monday, October 26th, at 5:30 pm.
We can't wait to see you there!


**Illuminate - A night of Prayer and Priase**

The 4pm English music team will be hosting a praise & prayer night in November.

Join us for Illuminate, where we will explore what the Bible says about light and the promise of Jesus as our true Light. Come and be refreshed, encouraged, and reminded of the hope that shines in Him.

All are welcome, and invite a friend!

**Berkeley Life Centre: Summer Clothing Donations - A Big Success!** 

A huge thank you to everyone who generously donated summer clothing over the last couple of weeks for the Berkeley Life Centre (BLC)! BLC Senior Pastor Beejai came on Monday to pick up the clothes, and his 4WD vehicle was comfortably filled to nearly every available inch! Your kindness will make a real difference to individuals and families in the community supported by the Berkeley Life Centre.
Thank you again for your wonderful generosity!
