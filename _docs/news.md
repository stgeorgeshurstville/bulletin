## General

**Inner Lawn Turf (Phase 1) at Church is Finished!**

We're thrilled to announce that the first phase of the artificial turf replacement on the inner lawn of the main church site is now complete! 
A tremendous thank you once again to the dedicated volunteers who worked hard and efficiently last week. Your service made this upgrade possible! The new turf looks fantastic and provides a beautiful space for our community to use.
The momentum continues! Our next major project is the replacement of the hall flooring. This essential work will significantly improve the function of our hall gathering space. We know many of you cherish our community spaces, and these projects rely entirely on your generosity. 
Please prayerfully consider continuing your giving towards the Church Building Fund to ensure we can continue improvements and maintenance for our entire site. Thank you for investing in the future of our church home!

**Change in parking conditions**

**Staff changes** 

We are writing to let you know that our Pastoral Counsellor, Tim Chan, has resigned from his role. His last day with us will be November 18th, before he takes some final leave.

Tim has been called to serve as the minister at Auburn Presbyterian Church, a small congregation that has been without a pastor for nearly a year. 

We see this as a wonderful, God-given missional opportunity, and we are thankful that Tim is willing to take on this role. We trust that this new position will be a great fit for his gifts, and we pray for God's blessing on him and Wendy in this new chapter.

We are truly grateful for Tim's five years of faithful service among us. As the Bible encourages us in 1 Timothy 5:17, we want to honour him for his work. 

We know that for a small number of you who have shared a close, personal connection with Tim and Wendy, this news will be sad. Your care for them is a testament to the deep relationships formed within our church family.

To thank God for Tim and Wendy, and to give us a chance to say a proper goodbye and pray for them, we will be holding a farewell afternoon tea.

**Please join us on:****Saturday, 15th November at 4:00 PM**

We hope you can come to wish Tim and Wendy well as we send them out to this important work.


**Life Course!**

Whether you are a genuine seeker or a skeptic, come to our Life Course where we will consider the life-changing message of the Gospel as it relates to the person of Jesus.

The course started last week but it’s not too late to join us as we think about the relationship between Jesus and his father in heaven and how that can have an effect upon us as people. 

We’ll be meeting in the middle seminar room at 5:30pm this Sunday. 


**Illuminate - A night of Prayer and Praise**

The 4pm English music team will be hosting a praise & prayer night in November.


Join us for Illuminate, where we will explore what the Bible says about light and the promise of Jesus as our true Light. Come and be refreshed, encouraged, and reminded of the hope that shines in Him.

All are welcome, and invite a friend!

**A New Year of Serving Together!**
As the new year rapidly approaches, we'd love for you to consider how you would like to continue serving our church. Everyone’s contribution is greatly appreciated as we seek to love people both inside and outside of our church community. 
As God's people, we are called to emulate the Lord Jesus, who came "not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." There are many areas in which you can serve our church in the coming year, and you’ll see those detailed in the form.

**An Epic Journey: Studying Isaiah**

This term, our church has started a journey of studying the Book of Isaiah, leading us all the way up to Christmas. It promises to be an epic spiritual journey as we trace the prophet’s message to his people and explore how that powerful message relates to us as God's people on this side of the cross.

To get the most out of our study of Isaiah, we encourage everyone to be reading it for themselves. As Christians, we know that hearing God's voice through His Word is essential to worshipping Him as Lord, but this vital task often gets squeezed out of our busy schedules.

So, to make the most of this epic journey, we encourage you to read all 66 chapters of Isaiah over the next 9 weeks. To help you on this journey, we’ve created a [9-week reading plan](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG16YkibTQ/h1WDqF08taLnE5OVQGcaVA/view?utm_content=DAG16YkibTQ&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h659a985df1) so that you can see the majesty of what God has done for his people.
