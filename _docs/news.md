### Christmas Mission Season 2025: Sharing the Good News

This December, from December 13th leading up to Christmas, we warmly invite all our church members to participate in our Christmas mission, where we will be sharing the good news of Jesus to those in our community.
To support this effort, a Team of students from UNSW will be with us from December 10th to December 14th.

### Christmas Market 2025

One of the key events during this season is our annual Christmas Market. This is a wonderful opportunity to connect with our local community, share the gospel, and extend practical care through charity fundraising.

### Inner Lawn Turf (Phase 1) at Church is Finished!

We're thrilled to announce that the first phase of the artificial turf replacement on the inner lawn of the main church site is now complete! 
A tremendous thank you once again to the dedicated volunteers who worked hard and efficiently last week. Your service made this upgrade possible! The new turf looks fantastic and provides a beautiful space for our community to use.
The momentum continues! Our next major project is the replacement of the hall flooring. This essential work will significantly improve the function of our hall gathering space. We know many of you cherish our community spaces, and these projects rely entirely on your generosity. 
Please prayerfully consider continuing your giving towards the Church Building Fund to ensure we can continue improvements and maintenance for our entire site. Thank you for investing in the future of our church home!

### Change in parking conditions

### A New Year of Serving Together!

As the new year rapidly approaches, we'd love for you to consider how you would like to continue serving our church. Everyone’s contribution is greatly appreciated as we seek to love people both inside and outside of our church community. 
As God's people, we are called to emulate the Lord Jesus, who came "not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." There are many areas in which you can serve our church in the coming year, and you’ll see those detailed in the form.
As you complete the form, please indicate:
- What ministry area(s) you are currently serving in.
- What new ministries you would like to consider serving.
Two areas in particular that we'd love for you to consider in our December and January period are: our Christmas Market (13th of December) and our New Gen Program (11th,18th and 25th of January).  You can nominate your preference for these seasonal roles in the form as well!

_Please note: Indicating a new area does not automatically mean you will be serving there. It will simply be the basis for a friendly conversation with one of our staff members. Together, we can consider what might be the best fit for you and our church.
Also this form is not the means for discontinuing a ministry in the new year. If you'd like to step down from a current team, then we'd like to direct you to have that conversation with the ministry leader of that team._
