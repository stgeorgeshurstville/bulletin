## General

### A new staffing for 2026

🎉We are pleased to announce that Pastor Carol Chiu has accepted my invitation to move from part-time to full-time ministry, with a revised role.

From 1 January 2026, Carol will serve as the pastor responsible for Youth and Children at St George’s. This role is not simply an extension of her current responsibilities, but a new pastoral role that involves oversight, leadership, and the ongoing development and restructuring of our youth and children’s ministries.

Carol has served as our NewGen Director since January 2020, during which time she has proven herself to be a faithful pastor and a capable leader. There is strong alignment between her experience and this new role, and we are confident that she is the right person to lead these ministries into their next season.

We give thanks to the Lord for his gracious provision to our church. Please pray for Carol and her husband, Jaffe, as they enter this period of transition.

### Growing Together: Discipleship Groups 2026
As we settle into the new year, we want to share an exciting update regarding our Discipleship Groups.

While our groups are currently in recess for the month of January, we are preparing to relaunch in early February! These groups are the heartbeat of our community—dedicated spaces for our regular members to grow together, study God’s Word, and encourage one another as we learn to better follow the Lord Jesus.

To help us place everyone in a group that fits their schedule, please fill out our [online form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXE4obODIdYkJuVEjM_f72rIKvcdW4yjre-ssMmP_LH3G6pQ/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=116695261415859153895) This provides us with a "window" into your weekly availability so we can form groups effectively.
