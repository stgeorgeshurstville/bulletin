## General

- **NEW 4pm NewGen Children Ministry:**
 Some practicalities to be aware of:
    - The Family Spot (segment to help the whole church family and give us language to speak about Jesus to kids) will take place in the 4pm English Service each week except for the 1st week of each month where it will take place in the 4pm Mandarin Service instead.
    - Parents will need to register and sign in their kids with one of the Kids Leaders when they arrive in service and sign out their kids from their group’s rooms.
    - Toddlers Time/Creche (0-4 years old) will take place in the Playgroup Room and 4pm NewGen (Preschool-Year 6) will take place in the Seminar Room.
- **Pastor Tim:** We have been extremely blessed that our Lord has sent Rev Tim and Wendy to minister among us. Overtime, it has become apparent that pastoral care and counselling is Tim’s particular gifting from the Lord. In recognition of this, Tim and I agree to a change in his role from the end of August. Tim will focus on providing pastoral counselling. He will expand his ministry from the Cantonese congregation to the whole church. And we will begin the process of recruiting a pastor for the Cantonese ministry thereafter. Please contact me if you have any questions. I wish to thank God for Tim for his diligence and faithfulness in his role for the past 3 years.   
- **Baptism:** Baptism is an outward sign of an inward reality and God’s grace towards his people who’ve come to trust in Jesus. Please speak to Rev. Alan if you are interested to be baptised in late Oct and early Nov. 
- **Seminar:** Dr Rev. Marshall Ballantine-Jones did his research on pornography and its impact on adolescents. He’ll be running some sessions to help us be aware of, address and think about some next steps for how to pursue holiness together. These sessions are for people who struggle with pornography, know people who struggle with it and people who want to be more informed. Our Pastors and some leaders will be available during the session and afterwards for ongoing support. The sessions are:
    1. for Parents on Fri 15th Sep 6:30-8pm (Seminar Room)
    2. for Adults on Sun 17th Sep 2-3:30pm in the Chapel (this session will be streamed)
    3. for Youths on Fri 5:30-7:30pm (Fri 20th Oct)
- **Conversion Practices: 
Act now on religious freedom and "conversion therapy"**
You may have heard that Alex Greenwich, the independent MP for Sydney, has introduced his 'conversion therapy' bill, and the NSW Government have also released a discussion paper for their own legislation.

Both proposals are modelled on the Victorian legislation that severely restricts religious freedoms to teach, pray and counsel on matters of gender and sexuality. This is despite explicit commitments from Labor before the election that they would not use Victoria's or Greenwich's legislation in NSW, and they would protect prayer, religious teaching, and consensual requests for support.

We are calling on Chris Minns and the Government to honour their promises, and we are calling on the Opposition and cross-bench to reject any bill that undermines religious freedom.

The most important thing right now is for lots of Christians to contact their local MP.

This website has tools and guides to help you write to, call, or arrange a meeting with your local MP to talk about conversion therapy and religious freedom. [The site has how-to guides, talking points, and hand-outs to give your MP.](https://contactyourmp.org.au)

Please take the time to call or write to your MP, and consider if you or a group of people could ask for a meeting.
**Pastoral Care and Support:** [Please read this article by Tim Keller for an overview of a Christian sexual ethics](https://www.christ2rculture.com/resources/Ministry-Blog/The-Gospel-and-Sex-by-Tim-Keller.pdf)
If you need support as a result of the subject matter raised over the few weeks on love, sex and marriage please talk to one of the staff (Alan, Brian or Glorya at 930am and Cate at 4pm). 

- **Building Fund:** Your gifts to the building has been making a HUGE difference so far: it has enabled us to use 124 Forest Rd and to bless others with this facility. The latest is that we were able to tile the church hall with rubber mats to help improve the sound. The next project we’ll be doing is to repair the church roof. As many of you know the church roof has been leaking for some time and is causing damage to the inside of the church. The costs to repair the roof is around $12,000. Work is due to commence this week.  If you would like to give towards this project or the building fund generally, you can do so to this account:
