## General

- **NEW 4pm NewGen Children Ministry:**
 Some practicalities to be aware of:
    - The Family Spot (segment to help the whole church family and give us language to speak about Jesus to kids) will take place in the 4pm English Service each week except for the 1st week of each month where it will take place in the 4pm Mandarin Service instead.
    - Parents will need to register and sign in their kids with one of the Kids Leaders when they arrive in service and sign out their kids from their group’s rooms.
    - Toddlers Time/Creche (0-4 years old) will take place in the Playgroup Room and 4pm NewGen (Preschool-Year 6) will take place in the Seminar Room.

- **AAC/SGH merger:**
    1. Please be intentionally welcoming: identify, introduce, include. 
    2. Some practical changes: 
        - There will be a combined 4pm service (Mandarin/English) to formally welcome AAC into SGH. All are welcomed to join.
        - 4pm English congregation will meet in the church Hall and the New Life Nepalese Church will meet at 124 Forest Rd.
        - The 4pm services will not be streamed, but the 930 English and 11am Mandarin services will be available on our website.
        - Dinner will be served each week in the Hall after the 4pm services. Costs: $5. The deadline for a Sun dinner order is **Saturday 12pm**. Please place your order by filling this [form](https://tinyurl.com/sundinners)

- **Berkeley Life Centre:**: We’ll hear from Berkeley Life Centre next week. They will run a training seminar (in English) about how to reach people in different demographics especially from lower socioeconomic backgrounds (Sunday 20th 1-2pm in the Seminar Room). We’ll also be visiting and partnering with Berkeley on the following Sat mornings (26 Aug, 23 Sep and 18 Nov). Please contact the mission subcommittee or Rev. Lam for more information. You can also find out more about how to partner with our mission partners here: https://stgeorgeshurstville.org.au/mission-partners

- **Building Fund:**: Your gifts to the building has been making a HUGE difference so far: it has enabled us to use 124 Forest Rd and to bless others with this facility. The latest is that we were able to tile the church hall with rubber mats to help improve the sound. The next project we’ll be doing is to repair the church roof. As many of you know the church roof has been leaking for some time and is causing damage to the inside of the church. The costs to repair the roof is around $12,000. Work is due to commence this week.  If you would like to give towards this project or the building fund generally, you can do so to this account: 

- Projects Account: BSB Number: 032-055 Account Number: 253052
  
- **Coffee Cart:**: We are serving baristas coffee after 9:30am church today. Order your coffee at the sign-in area. $3 (small) $4 (large). Why not buy coffee for someone you don’t know?
