## General

- **Working Bee**: Thanks for helping!
- **Mental Health Survey**: Our churches (in the Sydney and Illawarra region) along with Anglicare would like to better understand mental health issues in a church context so that we can better minister and support people who experience mental ill health. Please complete this 5-10 minute anonymous survey by 23 Feb. English survey [here](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=a4TV9b2J40q7h6Ul8dVj90QCMbGsUj9FkEI8yvLTMORUMDlWT01EQ0pZMlAxVEIxTkNRUUZFMTZSTi4u&origin=QRCode&qrcodeorigin=presentation).
