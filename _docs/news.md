## General
- **Church Office Returns to the Rectory** - After a year-long trial period, we've determined that the Rectory's Vestry is not the ideal location for our church office. Effective immediately, the office has returned to its original location at the Rectory. We extend our heartfelt thanks to:
  - Pastor Bijaya and family for their generous hospitality
  - Jen Tung and her team of volunteers for their hard work during the transition

    For security and confidentiality reasons, please note the office is now accessible only to staff members. We appreciate your understanding as we make this adjustment to better serve our church family.


**Over the next three weeks, get ready to explore the very heart of what we believe as we trace how our God came to earth to rescue us and unite us to himself.**
This week, and every week, is a great opportunity to invite friends and family to hear why this is good news for them. To get a taste of what's to come, why not read John 1:1-14?

- The Very Person of God - 4th of May (John 1:1-14)
- The Story of the First and Last Adam - 11th of May (Romans 5:12-19)
- Being United with Christ - 18th of May (Ephesians 2:1-10)

- [**What are you doing for God’s glory in 2025?**](https://forms.gle/dshYacLA1kB8xpkn7)
