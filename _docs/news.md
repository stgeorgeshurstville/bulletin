## General
- **Week of Prayer**: from 24-30 June. During this week, we will meet and pray at 1pm - 1:30pm.

They are coming up on 7 July, 14 July and 21 July and will be held at 9:30 English, 11am Mandarin and 4pm Mandarin services. Please look out for people you don’t normally see and make a point of saying hi and speaking to them!
