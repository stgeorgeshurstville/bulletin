- **Compassion**: ​​You can pick up a profile of a child and sponsor them at the Compassion stand. [You can also send in prayer points for the children you sponsor here so that our church family can be praying for your children and the region](https://forms.gle/t6nXQemD5EgYNdQP7).
- **Christmas Market**:  Join us for our Christmas Market on December 9th, 10 am to 2 pm, as we connect with the community, share the Gospel, serve together, and help our local community. Get involved by running a stall, joining our outreach team, inviting friends, or donating items for the charity sale. For more info, contact Howard Law / Sunny Yu / Bain Lam.

- **Baptism, Confirmation & Parking**: Baptism is an outward sign of an inward reality and God’s grace towards his people who’ve come to trust in Jesus. The people being baptised and/or confirmed on the 12 Nov are: Aiden, Danny, Tiffany, Naomi, Nathanael, Abigail, Annabel, Alana and Joshua at 9:30am and Swinson and Alvin at 4pm. In light of more people coming, please park offsite and leave onsite parking to those who need it e.g. those with mobility issues.
- **Israel-Gaza Conflict**: Many people have been and will be affected by this conflict. ARDF Australia is joining ARDF US in their effort to provide emergency relief to those affected by the crisis. Funds raised will support the work of CMJ-Israel to help victims of the conflict. [More info here](https://ardfa.org.au/global-disaster-fund/posts/israel-gaza-crisis-appeal)
