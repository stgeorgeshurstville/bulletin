## General
### 2026 Vision: Knowing the One True God and to Make Him Known
This year, our vision is to know the One True God and to make Him known. For many of us, "knowing God" can often be equated to simply knowing facts about Him. However, when the Bible speaks about knowing God, it describes seeing Him correctly so that it elicits a response of delight and awe. The more we understand His character and His qualities, the more we begin to marvel at what He has done for us through His Son.
To help us in this pursuit, we have started a six-week series on the Nicene Creed. This historic statement of belief has served the church for centuries by clarifying exactly who God is, helping His people to savor Him rightly.
Over the coming weeks, we invite you to pray that you would savor God in all His fullness as we strive to know Him more deeply together.

### Life Quarterly February 2026 edition is now available
The latest edition of Life Quarterly is now published. You can download it via our church website or get a printed copy to read as it contains the latest reports for AGM from our church staff. 
[this link](http://stgeorgeshurstville.org.au/agm2026) also contains all the relevant information for our upcoming AGM along with nomination forms for office bearers to be elected. 

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to your congregational pastors or email [this link](agm@stgeorgeshurstville.org.au)

### Upcoming Events: Combined Service & Annual General Meeting
## Save the Date: Sunday 8th March 
We are excited to invite the entire St George’s church family to **Combined Service & AGM**. This is a pivotal day in our calendar as we gather to celebrate what God has done and look forward with anticipation to where He is leading us in 2026.

## Sunday, 1st March: Preparations & Opportunities
**Pre-AGM Discussion:** To help us prepare for the official meeting on the 8th, we will be holding a Pre-AGM session. This is a vital time for open discussion on key issues and priorities, allowing us to enter the official meeting with clarity and shared understanding.
- 11:00am – Cantonese (church seminar room)
-  2:00pm – Mandarin (chapel)
-  3:00pm – English (chapel)

## Sunday, 8th March: Vision Sunday Schedule
This year, we will gather as one unified body for a special combined service.
- **10:00am – Combined Service:** Hurstville Public School Hall
- **12:00pm – Community Lunch:** Join us at the Main Site for a shared meal and fellowship.
- **1:00pm – Annual General Meeting:** Following lunch, we will meet in the Chapel for our AGM to hear ministry updates and participate in the stewardship of our church.

**Please note:** For this week only, we ask that you avoid parking in the Kelwyn Street car park unless you have mobility issues. This is to accommodate the Community-Based Language School that meets on-site every week. Thank you for your cooperation!

For other congregations members, follow the map to Hurstville Public School:

### Preparing in Prayer
We believe that our plans only succeed when they are rooted in prayer. We invite you to join leadership and fellow members to seek God’s wisdom at any of our open prayer meetings:
- Wednesday, 4th March @ 1:30pm
- Saturday, 7th March @ 3:00pm
- Sunday, 8th March @ 4:00pm
  

## New to the Family? Join "The Bridge"
If you’ve recently moved into the area or have started making this your home church after moving from another congregation, we’d love to officially welcome you.

We know that transitioning to a new church can feel a bit like being the "new kid at school," even if you’ve been a Christian for years. **The Bridge** is a casual, short-term group designed specifically for you to get to know our Senior Minister, hear the heart and vision of our church, and connect with others who are also new to the pews.

- **When:** Friday evenings at 6:00 PM (the first meeting will be this coming *Friday, 13 February, 2026*).
- **Where:** Meet at the church foyer
- **The Plan:** We’ll gather briefly, then head out to a local restaurant for dinner together.
- **Duration:** We’ll have you wrapped up and ready for your weekend by 7:30 PM.

Before you jump into a permanent small group, come spend a few Friday nights with us. It’s the easiest way to move from "visiting" to "belonging."
