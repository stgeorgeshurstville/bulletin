## General
- **Re: 124 Forest Rd:**
    - Dear Church Family, We want to share some important news regarding 124 Forest Rd. At the end of June 2025, we will no longer have access to the premises, as the building is set to be demolished. This space was a blessing, provided by the Lord through the generosity of our members when we needed more room for Sunday services. While this is disappointing, it is not unexpected, and we trust that God will continue to lead us forward. As we seek alternative premises, we invite you to pray for wisdom in making the right decisions‚Äîconsidering location, cost, and the future needs of our church. To discuss and pray about the future direction of our church‚Äîincluding property, resources, and redevelopment‚Äîwe encourage you to join us for a Church Prayer & Vision Meeting on:
    - üìÖ Sunday, 2 March 2025
    - üïë 2:00 PM
    - üìç At the Church

- The following Sunday, 9 March 2025, we will have our AGM Sunday:
Combined Morning Service at 10:30am in Chapel and the Annual General Meeting at 1pm in Chapel. Please mark these dates in your calendar and continue to pray for God‚Äôs guidance.

- The 2025 Autumn Life Quarterly has been published, which contains ministries reports for the Annual General Meeting, testifying to God's wonderful work in the church and in each person's life. Don't miss it. For more information, please visit the church website: https://stgeorgeshurstville.org.au/agm2025

- **Youth Group has started**: Reminder that it is every Friday from 7pm to 9pm. Find our more details [here](https://stgeorgeshurstville.org.au/youth-group)

Looking to deepen your understanding of the Bible and connect with others? Our discipleship groups have kicked off for the year, and anyone is welcome to join.
