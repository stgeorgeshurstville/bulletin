# Sermon Series: What would Jesus says to...
### The Exhausted (Luke 10:38-42)

As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”. 
Matthew 3:16-17
