## The Heart of Jesus 
#### When John came, he didn’t eat or drink as you do. And people say, ‘He has a demon.’ But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank as you do. And people say, ‘This fellow is always eating and drinking far too much. He’s a friend of tax collectors and “sinners.”
##### Matthew 11:18,19 NIRV
