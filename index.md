## The Sufficiency of Christ

### His Sufficiency in my Transformation



#### All that you have done to us, Lord, you have done in true judgment; for we have sinned in all things and have not obeyed your commandments; give glory to your Name, O Lord, and deal with us in your forbearance.
##### Song of the Three Young Men 8,17,20,19
